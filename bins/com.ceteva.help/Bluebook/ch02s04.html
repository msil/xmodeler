    managing the properties of model elements. Right clicking and selecting
    Edit on an element will display a property editor for that element. For
    example, editing the package Components (in the browser) will show the
    properties of the package:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/propertyeditpackage.jpg"></div><p>Single value properties (slots) are displayed on the left hand of
    the property editor. For instance, the package Components has a name slot
    whose value is "Component" and an owned slot whose value is the "Root"
    package. The "of" slot is the class that the element is an instance "of",
    in this case, a Package.</p><p>Double clicking on the value of a slot will display a property
    editor for that element, for example clicking on the Component class in
    the classes list will show the property editor for the class
    Component..</p><p>One of the powerful features of XMF-Mosaic is its uniform
    representation of its own implementation. To see this, double cllck on the
    "of" slot. This will display a property editor for the class Package - the
    class that defines what a package is.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/packagedit.jpg"></div><p>When navigating through the properties of large models, it is often
    useful to be able to quickly flick back to previous property editors.
    Rather than displaying hundreds of tabs, XMF-Mosaic provides buttons for
    managing property editor histories. These can be found in the top right
    hand bar of the property editor. The left and right hand arrows allow you
    to move between previous and next editors in the history.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/propertyedit.jpg"></div><p>A list of all the editors can be seen by clicking on the up and down
    arrows. A history can be deleted by clicking on the eraser icon. Finally,
    property editors can be kept as tabs by clicking on the lock icon - when a
    new property editor is shown, it will be displayed in a new tab. This is
    useful when comparing two or more properties.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
