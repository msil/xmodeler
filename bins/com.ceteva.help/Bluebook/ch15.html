  supports a convenient project management abstraction called a manifest. A
  manifest provides a convenient way of managing collections of files that
  have dependencies on each other.</p><p>In version 1.0 of XMF, manifests must be declared in a file. The
  following file imports the Manifest facility and implements a manifest that
  compiles Airports.xmf file followed by AirportsCons.xmf:</p><pre class="programlisting">parserImport Manifests;

@Manifest Airports
  p = @File Airports end
  @File AirportsCons end
end;</pre><p>A manifest is declared using @Manifest. A manifest has a name (in this
  case Airports) and contains a list of files.</p><p>Save, Compile and Load the Manifest (right click &gt; Save, Compile
  and Load). A manifest icon will appear in the file browser which contains
  some additional menu options:</p><p>The two additional options are:</p><p>Build Manifest: This will compile all the files in the
  manifest.</p><p>Load Manifest: This will load the binary of the files.</p><p>Compile, Build and Load: Compiles the Manifest, then Builds and Loads
  the files.</p><p>These can be used to compile and load as many files as required in a
  specific development project.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
