      standard execution architecture. This architecture is extensible; new
      language constructs can be added dynamically. This section describes the
      basic features of the XMF execution architecture and how the extension
      mechanism works so that new languages can be embedded within XOCL.</p><p>The basic execution process parses an input source and synthesizes
      a performable element. XMF provides a large number of performable
      elements in XOCL and its various language extensions. You can easily
      define your own type of performable elements in terms of how they are
      parsed and executed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id601770"></a>Performable Elements</h3></div></div></div><p>An XMF performable element implements an interface that supports
      its evaluation. Evaluation can occur in one of two ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Interpretation. This occurs via the element&#8217;s eval operation and
      invokes an interpreter that inspects the structure of the element and
      returns its value. The eval operation takes arguments that define the
      context of the interpretation. The context defines the value of self,
      the value of any variables and the name spaces that are imported at the
      point of evaluation.</p></li><li><p>Compilation. This occurs via the element&#8217;s compile operation and
      invokes a compiler that translates the receiver into a sequence of
      XMF-VM instructions. The compilation operation takes a number of
      arguments that define the compilation context.</p></li></ul></div><p>In both cases, as far as the user of XMF is concerned, the key
      factor is that the target of evaluation is an instance of
      XCore::Performable. Therefore, any user interface that executes
      interpretation or compilation must translate from input to a performable
      element.</p><p>The majority of user interfaces to this process accept text as
      input. The text is parsed using a grammar and a performable instance is
      synthesized. Therefore, to hook into the evaluation process of XMF you
      need to understand how to write grammars that recognize new language
      constructs and synthesize performable elements. Fortunately, there are a
      number of XMF technologies that ease this activity.</p><p>The following example shows how a grammar that synthesizes
      performable elements is linked into the XMF evaluation architecture. The
      example is a simplified version of the XMF top level command
      interpreter:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image042.jpg"></div><p>The eval operation accepts a grammar argument in line 8. The
      grammar should synthesize a performable instance that is subsequently
      evaluated in line 26. If OCL::OCL.grammar is supplied to eval then the
      operation behaves like the XMF-Mosaic top level command
      interpreter.</p><p>Compilation of performable elements occurs when you compile an XMF
      source file. The compiler reads the input source, synthesizes a
      performable element, compiles the element to a sequence of machine
      instructions and then writes the instructions to a binary file.</p><p>Instead of writing to a binary file, the instructions can be
      transformed to a compiled operation using the operation
      Compiler::compileToFun as shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image044.jpg"></div><p>The free variables of the element are calculates in line 18 and
      used as the argument names for the operation constructed in line
      25.</p><p>The key feature of operations eval and compile is that the XML
      evaluation architecture reads sources of XMF program code, parses the
      input using a grammar, synthesizes an instance of XCore::Performable and
      then interprets or compiles the element.</p><p>XOCL allows new language constructs to be added as describes in
      the following section. The new constructs are defined as grammars that
      are integrated into the XOCL grammar. Language extensions that are added
      in this way should therefore synthesize performable elements.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id629455"></a>Syntax Extensions</h3></div></div></div><p></p></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
