    was constructed. In practice however, the objective will be to generate
    concrete code (not just an instance of the C# model). For example, we
    might expect to generate some code of the following form:</p><pre class="programlisting">using System;

  class Route 
  {
    integer capacity;
    string name;
    string source;
    string destination;
  }
  class Passenger 
  {
    string name;
  }
  class Airline 
  {
    string name;
  }
  class Airport 
  {
    string name;
  }
  class Flight 
  {
    string date;
  }</pre><p>The basic approach is to add operations to the language model to
    pretty print it. The first step is to load your language model and plan
    where the appropriate operations need to be added. In general, it is best
    to start at the leaf classes where there is minimum dependency on other
    elements in the model.</p><p>As an example, a pretty print operation can be added to the class
    CPPAtt (a C# attribute). First, add a pretty print operation to the class
    and give it a name, e.g. pprint().</p><p>Now, edit the operation. Two parameters are required by the
    operation: an output type, out, which will be used to direct the output of
    the operation to an editor or to a file, and an indent, which is the
    current indent of the code.</p><p>We can now construct the body of the operation. An attribute will be
    pretty printed as the type name and the attribute name, terminated with a
    semicolon.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Operation pprint(out : XCore::Element,indent : XCore::Element):XCore::Element
      format(out,"~V~S~%",Seq{indent, type.name + " " + name + ";"})
    end</pre><p>The format command is used to generate the text. The sequence of
    control characters dictates the format of elements that occur in the
    sequence of elements that are to be formatted. For example, ~V denotes a
    vertical space, ~S is a string and ~% is a line return. Note, full details
    of the format command can be found in Part 3 of this guide.</p><p>In this case an indent is inserted before the string is printed, and
    a character return is inserted after the semicolon.</p><p>The definition of pprint on CSClass is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Operation pprint(out : XCore::Element,indent : XCore::Element):XCore::Element
      format(out,"~V~S~%",Seq{indent,"class " + name + " ",indent,"{"});
      attributes-&gt;collect(a |
        a.pprint(out,indent + 2));
      format(out,"~V~S~%",Seq{indent,"}"})
    end</pre><p>The class signature and name of the class is printed followed by the
    attributes and operations of the class.</p><p>Finally, we need to construct the pretty printer for a
    CSProgram.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Operation pprint(out : XCore::Element,indent : XCore::Element):XCore::Element
      format(out,"~V~S~%",Seq{indent,"using System;"});
      classes-&gt;collect(c |
        a.pprint(out,indent + 2))
    end
</pre><p>If we run the pprint operation on the result of mapping the Airports
    package, the following code is generated:</p><pre class="programlisting">using System;

  class Route 
  {
  }
  class Passenger 
  {
  }
  class Airline 
  {
  }
  class Airport 
  {
  }
  class Flight 
  {
  }</pre><p>A lot more needs to be done to complete the mapping. In particular
    mappings from Attribute and Operation to C# Attributes and Operations need
    to be defined. However, it is simply a case of following the same overall
    approach.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
