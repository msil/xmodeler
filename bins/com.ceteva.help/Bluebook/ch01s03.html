      developers who wish to have complete control over the tools they use in
      their development processes. In comparison with building tools in
      general-purpose languages like Java, XMF-Mosaic offers significant
      reduction in construction effort, better extensibility, and a more
      intuitive and integrated solution to tool construction. This also
      applies to IDE's like Eclipse. XMF-Mosiac provides a next level of
      abstraction over typical IDE facilities. For example, XMF-Mosaic
      provides domain specific programming languages for building
      user-interfaces, which are significantly more productive than
      programming the interfaces from scratch even in an IDE.</p><p>There are some strong business cases for developing tool solutions
      that precisely fit your development processes. Here are some:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Tools that specifically target a problem domain
            significantly increase productivity. They achieve this by reducing
            the design space, enabling developers to focus on what they are
            developing, rather than how to express the same information in a
            general purpose language.</p></li><li><p>Code and documentation generators are easier to write as the
            source of the generators is a precisely targetted domain
            model.</p></li><li><p>Creating a domain model is a benefit in its own right as it
            gives a deeper understanding of the concepts that the business
            works with.</p></li><li><p>Automation becomes a key part of the development processes.
            Once instilled, this process can lead to large costs savings
            across many parts of an organisation.</p></li></ul></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
