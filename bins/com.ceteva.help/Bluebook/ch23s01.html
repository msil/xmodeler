    interacting with the environment outside of its own world. There are
    numerous ways of providing this interaction including file based IO and
    XML based IO. A further way of providing this interaction which is
    particularly well suited, but not limited, to user interfaces is to write
    a client which sits between the user interface and the XMF kernel. This is
    the approach taken to implementing the Mosaic components of XMF-Mosaic and
    XMF (specifically its underlying operating system XOS) provides a number
    of mechanisms to support this activity. These mechanisms are discussed and
    illustrated in this document.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
