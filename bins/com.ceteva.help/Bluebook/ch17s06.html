        implemented by translating to existing syntax constructs. The
        translation is often referred to as desugaring. It is convenient to
        create an instance of a new syntax class and then to desugar when the
        construct when XMF performs an evaluation or compilation request on
        the instance. By leaving the desugaring step to the last possible
        moment, the structure of the original syntax construct is retained for
        as long as possible.</p><p>Grammars that synthesize instances of new syntax classes can
        then use operations defined on the classes to implement the desugaring
        step. The classes can be as complex or as simple as required. In the
        limit, a sugared syntax class can implement a complete compiler for a
        complex new syntax construct, where the compiler produces performable
        elements.</p><p>XMF provides a sub-class of XCore::Performable called
        XOCL::Sugar that implements evaluation and compilation in terms of a
        call to an operation desugar. The desugaring operation performs a
        mapping from the receiver to a new performable object that already
        implements the evaluation or compilation. This section describes how
        to use XOCL::Sugar.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id680269"></a>Guarded Statements</h4></div></div></div><p>Consider a new language feature that implements a guarded
        statement. A guarded statement is to be implemented as an if
        expression with no else clause. The following is an example of its
        use:</p><pre class="programlisting">@When passengers &gt; 63 do
  format(stdout,&#8221;Too many people on the bus.~%&#8221;)
end</pre><p>The conditional statement is implemented as a sugared syntax
        class whose desugar operation produces the equivalent if
        expression:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image060.jpg"></div><p>The grammar for a when-statement synthesizes an instance of the
        When class:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image062.jpg"></div><p>The desugar operation produces an instance of performable for a
        lower-level construct. In this case we produce an if expression and
        lose the fact that the then-part was guarded and the else-part was
        inserted.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image064.jpg"></div><p>By providing a pprint operation in the syntax class for When we
        will see the original statement in any source code that is saved by
        the XMF compiler:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image066.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id629326"></a>Conditional Expressions</h4></div></div></div><p>Suppose we are developing a system that involves testing a large
        number of conditions. The conditions can be tested using nested
        if-expressions, however this gets difficult to read as the number of
        nested expressions increases. Suppose that XMF did not provide an
        elseif keyword as part of an if-expression and that, therefore, there
        is a requirement for a tabular conditional expression of the following
        form:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Cond
  self.inRange(x,0,m) do
    self.tooLow(x)
  end
  self.inRange(x,m,n) do
    self.justRight(x)
  end
  self.inRange(x,n,infinity) do
    self.tooHigh(x)
  end
end</pre><p>where each clause is tried in turn until a test evaluates to
        true whereupon the corresponding action is performed.</p><p>We can implement the conditional expression above using sugar as
        follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image068.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image070.jpg"></div><p>Notice that the cond-expression synthesizes instances of
        CondClause in line 41 as part of the overall synthesis of a Cond. This
        is typical of a sugared construct which needs to represent internal
        structure prior to the desugaring process. The instances of CondClause
        are transient and exist only long enough to process the containing
        Cond. In general, many such transient objects may be created when
        processing sophisticated sugared constructs.</p><p>A cond-expression is desugared into a nested
        if-expression:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image072.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id684717"></a>Syntax</h3></div></div></div><p></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id570690"></a>Exp</h3></div></div></div><p></p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id606341"></a>Introduction</h4></div></div></div><p></p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id631711"></a>State Machines</h4></div></div></div><p>State machines are ubiquitous in Software Engineering. Whilst
        the basic notion of a state machine is very simple (the idea that
        components have a number of states and execution occurs when the
        component changes from one state to another) there are a huge number
        of ways in which state machines are implemented and deployed.</p><p>Fortunately, XMF-Mosaic makes it very easy to construct a state
        machine model and to define its semantics. This section shows how
        XCore::Class can be extended to provide states and transitions. The
        example shows a number of technologies:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>A new language for defining state machines. The language
            provides constructs for state machines; states; initial states and
            transitions. Transitions have guards and actions both of which are
            implemented using the XOCL::Exp.</p></li><li><p>Meta-classes. The class StateMachine is an extension of
            XCore::Class and as such supports class-contents such as
            attributes and operations. The new meta-class defines attributes
            for states and transitions and a number of meta-operations for
            running the state machine against objects with state.</p></li><li><p>Daemons. An instance of a state machine class is an object
            with state. A state machine monitors changes in the state of its
            instances by placing a daemon on each instance. When the daemon
            fires, the state machine determines whether any of its transitions
            are enabled and performs any enabled actions.</p></li></ul></div><p>The following model shows the classes in the state machine
        language:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image074.jpg"></div><p>The key features of the model are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Instances of StateMachine are classes with states and
        transitions. Therefore we can have instances of state machines.</p></li><li><p>The class ObjectWithState is defines to be a parent of any state
        machine. This class defines an attribute state that records the
        current state of the state machine instance.</p></li><li><p>Transitions have predicates and actions that are implemented as
        expressions. The expressions will be run against an object with state
        when it changes.</p></li></ul></div><p>The model above defines a domain specific language for
        representing state machines. In addition to defining the structure of
        state machines, the model defines the executable semantics for state
        machines. Before showing how the semantics is defined, we give two
        examples of how state machines are used to implement simple
        applications. The first example shows traffic lights and the second
        example shows a vending machine.</p><p>The following state machine implements a simple traffic light
        system: </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image076.jpg"></div><p>Line 6 introduces a state machine and names it. State machines
        may contain the same elements as classes and line 12 and 13 define the
        state that is manipulated by the state machine. The event attribute is
        monitored by the state machine and corresponds to events received from
        an external source such as a timer.</p><p>Lines 17 &#8211; 20 define the states for the machine. At any time an
        instance of TrafficLight must be in one of the states: Red, RedAmber,
        Green or Amber. The transitions that control how a traffic light
        changes between these states are defined below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image078.jpg"></div><p>A transition has a name, a source and target state name, a guard
        and an action. For example the transition defined in line 24 is named
        t1, changes between state Red and RedAmber, occurs when the traffic
        light state changes so that event is true and updates the value of the
        event slot to be false.</p><p>A traffic light is defined to change state when it receives an
        event (the value of the event slot changes to be true). The state is
        changed and the event flag is reset.</p><p>A vending machine dispenses cans of drink. Each can has a price;
        a customer enters coins into the machine until the value of the coins
        exceeds the price of a can. A can is dispensed and the machine waits
        for any change to be withdrawn before waiting for the next
        customer.</p><p>A vending machine is either idle (waiting for a customer),
        vending (accepting coins up to the price of a can), or waiting for
        change to be removed. The vending machine state machine is defined
        below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image080.jpg"></div><p>As a textual definition:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image082.jpg"></div><p>The transitions for a vending machine are defined below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image084.jpg"></div><p>The semantics of state machines is defined as a package
        below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image086.jpg"></div><p>The class ObjectWithState is typical of a pattern occurring when
        defining new meta-classes. The new meta-class StateMachine (below)
        requires that its instances have a support system. In this case the
        support system is the attribute state and associated operations. When
        instances of StateMachine are created, the class ObjectWithState is
        added as a parent of the resulting class. This ensures that instances
        of instance of StateMachine have the correct basic slots and
        supporting operations.</p><p>When an XMF object is created via a constructor, the init
        operation is called with the constructor arguments. An object with
        state needs to install a daemon that monitors state changes (any slot
        modification). The daemon inspects the state machine controlling the
        object and fires any enabled state transition. In addition an object
        with state must initialise the state slot.</p><p>The init operation for ObjectWithState is defined below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image088.jpg"></div><p>The daemon added to an object with state uses a handler
        slotChanged. This handler is called whenever a slot of the object
        monitored by the daemon changes. A daemon may be added to more than
        one object (here the daemon is created on a per-object basis). The
        type of the daemon determines which slot it monitors. In this case the
        type Daemon::ANY defines that the handler is called when any slot of a
        monitored object changes.</p><p>The handler used by the daemon is defined by the class
        ObjectWithState. A daemon handler is passed four arguments:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The object whose state has changed.</p></li><li><p>The name of the slot that has changed.</p></li><li><p>The new value of the slot.</p></li><li><p>The old value of the slot.</p></li></ul></div><p>In the following we check that the slot is not the state slot
        and then calculate the transitions that are enabled. If any
        transitions are enabled then one is selected at random and its action
        is performed. Both the predicate and the action are expressions. An
        expression has an operation perform that is used to evaluate the
        expression. The perform operation is supplied with a value for self in
        the expression and a sequence of local variable values. The target
        argument is used in the same way as that to Operation::invoke where
        unqualified slot references are resolved with respect to the supplied
        target object.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image090.jpg"></div><p>The class StateMachine is defined as a meta-class that creates
        sub-classes of ObjectWithState:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image092.jpg"></div><p>A state machine is a new language feature. The grammar is
        defined on lines 72 &#8211; 79 and is a simple example of how to define a
        new syntax feature for a new type of meta-class. The syntax definition
        for Class (as in @Class X &#8230; end) expands to a collection of calls to
        add for each contained definition (for example attributes and
        operations). A class knows how to add the supplied elements. This is
        exploited above, by just allowing state machines to contain arbitrary
        expressions each of which will be evaluated and the resulting element
        supplied as an argument to add on the state machine. We then leave it
        to an extended definition of add in StateMachine to handle any new
        types of element that we wish to add to a state machine, leaving the
        definition of Class::add to handle the rest:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image094.jpg"></div><p>When a new state machine is created we must arrange for it to
        inherit from ObjectWithState so that its instances get the state slot
        and associated initialisation support. All name spaces must be
        initialised via the init() operation prior to use. Normally this
        occurs automatically and you are not aware of the call to init (for
        example defining context P @Class C &#8230; end automatically calls init
        when C is added to P). We extend the initialisation below to add in
        the required super-class:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image096.jpg"></div><p>Operations used via ObjectWithState:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image098.jpg"></div><p>In this example of state machines, a state is just a name. We
        define a new syntax construct for defining a state. A more
        sophisticated implementation of state machines might, for example,
        introduce enter and exit actions for states or allow nested state
        machines:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image100.jpg"></div><p>An initial state is just a state. We use the type of an initial
        state to select the initial state of a state machine:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image102.jpg"></div><p>A transition is implemented as a new syntax construct as
        follows. The guard and action on a transition are implemented as an
        expression (XOCL::Exp) that is performed in order to check whether the
        transition is enabled and when the transition fires
        respectively:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image104.jpg"></div></div></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
