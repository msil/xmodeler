    powerful language for writing programs and constraints on models. XOCL is
    based on OCL (the Object Constraint Language) but extends it with
    programming features that make it much more productive.</p><p>XOCL includes many useful features, including facilities for
    conveniently navigating around models, and for filtering and manipulating
    model data. XOCL is based on standard OO programming principles, which
    means it is easy to learn. XOCL can be used in a wide variety of places in
    a model; wherever there is a need to evaluate a property of a model or
    modify it in some way. This means that once you have learnt XOCL it can be
    used in many different contexts.</p><p>This chapter provides a walkthrough of the key features of XOCL. It
    includes an introduction to its basic types, the basic features offered by
    XOCL for manipulating values and navigating around models, and its
    imperative programming features.</p><p>For an in-depth description of all the features of XOCL, see Part 3
    of the Bluebook.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
