      of a database. In doing so, it exercises a number of key XMap features,
      including pattern nesting, variable passing and multiple domain inputs
      to mappings.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id706609"></a>Class Model</h4></div></div></div><p>The following model describes the concepts in the class model.
        It includes most of the concepts that are typically found in a class
        model, including classes, packages, associations and
        generalization.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image030.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id623644"></a>Database Model</h4></div></div></div><p>The database model contains a collection of typical relational
        database concepts. A relational database contains a collection of
        tables, which have names. Each table contains a collection of columns,
        which are named. A Column has a type. A table always contains a Key,
        which is a pointer to the Column that uniquely identifies an instance
        of a Table. A table may also contain ForeignKey&#8217;s. These relate a
        Column to the Column in another table that it is the foreign key
        for.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image032.jpg"></div><p>There will be a significant number of constraints on this model.
        For example, it must never be the case that a foreign key refers to a
        column in the same table as the foreign key column:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image034.jpg"></div><p>As an example of a database model that could be represented by
        this model, consider the tables Account and Customer. The table
        Account has three columns, customerId, accountNo and balance. The
        column customerId is a foreign key &#8211; it ties each instance of an
        account to a specific customer. The column accountNo is a key, as it
        uniquely identifies the account. The column &#8216;balance&#8217; just represents
        some information about the account. Similarly, the table customer has
        three columns, one of which, customerId, is its key.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image036.jpg"></div><p>The following diagram shows the same information as it would be
        represented by an instance of the Database model:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id603821"></a>Database Mapping</h4></div></div></div><p>The following model describes how class models are transformed
        into database models:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image038.jpg"></div><p>A package is mapped to an instance of Tables. This contains the
        results of mapping each Class in the package into a Table. Each Table
        contains a collection of columns, each of which is the result of
        mapping the attributes of the Class into a Column. In the case of an
        Attribute that is marked as a key, a Key is created which points to
        the corresponding Column.</p><p>Let&#8217;s take each mapping in turn and explain how it works:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>PackageToTables</em></span></p><p>The PackageToTables mapping contains the following
        clause:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image040.jpg"></div><p>Here, the input to the mapping requires a Package containing
        some classes C and some associations A. If there is a match then the
        action after the &#8216;do&#8217; part is executed. In this case, it creates an
        instance of the class Tables, and sets its tables to be T. T is
        defined in the &#8216;where&#8217; part. T is calculated as the result of mapping
        each class in C to a table.</p><p>Note Associations will be dealt with in future versions of this
        example.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>ClassToTable</em></span></p><p>The first part of the ClassToTable mapping is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Clause0
  ClassModels::Class[
        name = className,
        attributes = 
          A-&gt;including(
            ClassModels::Attribute[
              name = attName,
              isPrimary = true,
              type = 
                ClassModels::DataType[
                  name = typeName
                ]
          ]) 
       ]</pre><p>This pattern expects a Class, and matches the name of
        the Class with the variable className.</p><p>In addition, this pattern illustrates the use of a collection
        pattern to match with an element in a collection. In this case, it
        matches if the attributes of the class bind with a collection of
        attributes A provided that it includes a primary attribute. This
        matches provided that the attribute is a primary Attribute, and binds
        the name of the attribute to the variable attName.</p><p>A similar type of pattern is used to return the name of the type
        of the attribute. Here the attribute type is matched against a
        DataType, whose name is then bound to the variable typeName.</p><p>Provided there is a match, the following action is
        invoked:</p><pre class="programlisting">do
  DatabaseModels::Table[
    name = className,
    key = DatabaseModels::Key[
             column = c],
    columns = C-&gt;including(c)].setOwnership()
  where
    c = DatabaseModels::Column[ 
          name = attName,
          type = typeName];
    C = Attribute2Column()(A)
end</pre><p>This creates an instance of a Table, whose name is the class
        name, and which has a Key that points to a Column that has the same
        name and type as the primary Attribute.</p><p>In addition, the columns of the Table are calculated by mapping
        each of the remaining attributes in A to columns and including the key
        column.</p><p>Finally, the operation setOwnership is called on the generated
        table. This sets the owner attribute of all the columns of the table,
        its foreign keys and key to be the table. It is defined as
        follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Operation setOwnership():Element
  @For c in columns do
    c.owner := self
  end;
  @For f in foreignKeys do
    f.owner := self
  end;
  key.owner := self;
  self
end</pre><p>The modified table is returned by the final self.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Attribute2Column</em></span></p><p>The attribute to column mapping takes a collection of attributes
        and maps them to columns. There are three clauses in this
        mapping.</p><p>The first one just returns the empty set if there are no
        attributes:</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Clause1
  Set{}
do
  Set{}
end</pre><p>The second clause matches if the attributes match the collection
        A that includes a attribute whose type is a datatype. If so, it
        creates a collection of columns, C, which includes a new column whose
        name and type is equal to the name and type of the attribute. However,
        C is calculated by passing the remaining attributes A to self, which
        in this case is the Attribute2Column mapping. Thus, it recurses
        through all the attributes applying the appropriate Attribute2Column
        clauses until they are consumed.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Clause0
  A-&gt;including(ClassModels::Attribute[
     name = attName,
     type = ClassModels::DataType[
         name = typeName] ])
  do
  C-&gt;including(DatabaseModels::Column[
     name = attName,
     type = typeName])
  where
    C = self(A)
end</pre><p>The third clause perfoms a similar function to the above, but in
        this case it only matches if the type of the attribute is a class. In
        this case, it runs through the attributes in the type applying the
        Attribute2Column mapping to those elements and adding them to the
        collection. Once this is complete it modifies the resulting column
        names so that they reflect the name of the type.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Clause2
   A-&gt;including(ClassModels::Attribute[
     name = attName,
     type = class])
   when class.isKindOf(ClassModels::Class)
   do 
   C-&gt;union(self(class.attributes)-&gt;collect(col | 
        col.name := class.name + "_" + attName + "_" + col.name))
   where C = self(A)
end</pre></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id749344"></a>Running the Mapping</h3></div></div></div><p>As an example, the following snapshot shows an instance of the
