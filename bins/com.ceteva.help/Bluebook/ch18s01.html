    XMF-Mosaic defined tools. These classes form the kernel of XMF and are
    collectively called XCore. The classes are self-describing: all XCore
    classes are instances of XCore classes. This feature is called
    meta-circularity and is the key to modularity, uniformity and reusability
    throughout all system and user defined XMF tools. </p><p>XCore includes class definitions for the basic types including
    Integer, Boolean and String and collection types for sets and sequences of
    values. XCore is object-oriented, it provides basic notions of Object and
    Class. XCore is executable; it provides definitions for Performable
    entities and Operations. All system defined tools in XMF-Mosaic are
    instances of XCore; therefore tools that are defined to work on instances
    of XCore can be used on any XMF data. For example, general-purpose editors
    and mappings are provided by XMF that are guaranteed to work across all
    system and user defined data.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
