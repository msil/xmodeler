Model-driven
      development (MDD) is an approach to enterprise system and software
      development where the key drivers of the process are models. By
      capturing these artefacts as models, significant advantages can be
      achieved over traditional programming approaches. MDD has the potential
      to greatly reduce the cost of development by facilitating the automation
      of many important development processes, including validation of models
      and generation of code.</p><p>XMF-Mosaic enables the rapid development of model-driven solutions
      that are tailored to the specific needs of a customer or application
      domain. These tools provide significant help in automating and managing
      the development process.</p><p>Here are some examples of tools that can be built with
      XMF-Mosaic:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Tools for designing and inputting a specific type of product,
          e.g. an aircraft or a financial product.</p></li><li><p>Tools for transforming designs into code, for example,
          generating code from an aircraft model.</p></li><li><p>Tools for validating designs, for example validating the
          correctness of new financial products.</p></li></ul></div><p>In XMF-Mosaic, you create models that capture the key features of
      the concepts that are managed by the tool. XMF-Mosaic then provides a
      rich array of facilities for creating tools based around this
      model.</p><p>A key feature of XMF-Mosaic is that it is completely modelled in
      itself &#8211; in other words, it is used to design itself. Because the user
      has access to these models, it offers a highly open and extensible
      platform.</p><p>XMF-Mosaic is based on Eclipse (an industrial strength open source
      IDE) and supports a number of open standards for capturing tool data and
      behaviour.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
