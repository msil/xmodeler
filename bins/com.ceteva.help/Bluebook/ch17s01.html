		and parsing textual syntaxes. This is important when you wish to develop
		using a specialised textual programming language, or create parsers
		for existing programming languages.</p><p>This document describes how to use XMF-Mosaic to parse textual
    languages and consequently synthesize elements. A textual language is
    parsed when it is consumed character-by-character and checked against
    rules (a grammar) governing legal sequences of characters. As text is
    parsed, the grammar rules can perform actions that construct (or
    synthesize) new elements.</p><p>A textual language can synthesize anything. For example, if we define a
    domain model representing two-dimensional tables then a textual language
    can be defined that, when parsed, synthesizes instances of the class
    Table2D.</p><p>All textual interaction with XMF-Mosaic (for example file based or
    console based) is governed using a parser based on a grammar for XOCL. In
    this case the parser synthesizes XOCL program code that is subsequently
    passed to the XOCL compiler or the command interpreter.</p><p>XOCL provides a powerful mechanism that allows the XOCL grammar to
    be arbitrarily extended with new language features (becoming an extensible
    language). User defined grammars can be added incrementally as modules to the
    XOCL grammar. Providing the new extension synthesizes valid program code
    then the new language construct is assimilated into XOCL.</p><p>Working with grammars that synthesize program code occurs frequently
    when defining textual languages. The synthesizing actions are often required to
    produce large amounts of program code from a small amount of text (after
    all this is the point of defining a language). XMF provides technology that
    vastly reduces the amount of work necessary to define the synthesizing
    actions; the technology is called quasi-quotes.</p><p>Quasi-quotes are used to define code templates. A code template is a
    mapping from code fragments to a program by inserting the code fragments
    into a code pattern. The result of applying a template can be supplied as
    an argument to subsequent templates. Very large programs can be
    synthesized from humble beginnings.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
