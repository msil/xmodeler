    class.</p><p>The source model is a simple domain model of Airports:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/airlines.jpg"></div><p>Create or load the Airports model.</p><p>Next, create a new project Example1 containing the classes that we
    want to map between.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/mappingclasses.jpg"></div><p>Note, the Route class has been copied from the Airports model. This
    is achieved by right clicking on the class in the Airports model,
    selecting Drop in Class Diagram and then choosing the Example1
    package.</p><p>Next, a mapping is added to the model. Select the Mapping from the
    icons in the diagram editor and place it on the diagram and give it a
    name.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/addingamapping.jpg"></div><p>A mapping must have at least one domain and a single range.</p><p>Select these from the icons underneath the mapping icon.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/addingdomainandrange.jpg"></div><p>The domain is the input to the mapping and the range is its output.
    Although compulsory, it is important to think of the domain and range as
    indicating a dependency between a mapping and its constituents. In
    practice, the actual values passed to the mapping need not necessarily be
    of the domain type. Similarly, the range need not be of the target
    type.</p><p>The rules and actions performed by a mapping are described by
    <span class="emphasis"><em>clauses</em></span>. Add a new clause to a mapping by right
    clicking on the mapping in the diagram editor or browser and choosing New
    &gt; Clause.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/addingaclause.jpg"></div><p>Now, edit the clause by double clicking on it in the browser.</p><p>A clause editor will be displayed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/aclause.jpg"></div><p>A clause has a name, and a default clause expression followed by a
    &#8220;do&#8221; action.</p><p>The expression is a pattern that must be matched before the clause
    will fire.</p><p>When the clause is matched, the action after the 'do' will be
    performed.</p><p>We wish to capture the rule that a Route with a capacity less than
    250 will be mapped to a ShortHaul Route with the same name. In addition,
    we want to map a Route with a capacity &gt;= 250 to a LongHaul
    Route.</p><p>To achieve this we need to write two clauses. The first clause
    matches with a Route whose capacity is less than 250 and generates a Short
    Haul Route.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Short
  Airports::Route[
    name = N,
    source = S,
    destination = D,
    capacity = C]
when C &lt; 250
do
  ShortHaul[
    name = N,
    source = S,
    destination = D]
end</pre><p>Here:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The name of the clause has been changed to Short</p></li><li><p>The clause expression is a Route, whose name equals the variable
        'N', whose source and destination equals the variables 'S' and 'D' and
        whose capacity equals the variable C.</p></li><li><p>The when condition states that this clause can only fire if the
        capacity is &lt; 250.</p></li><li><p>The 'do' action creates a ShortHaul Route whose name is equal to
        the variable 'N', and which has the same source and
        destination.</p></li></ul></div><p>Note because the variables are global they are matched across the
    clause, ensuring for example that the name of the source Route matches the
    target Route name.</p><p>To enter the clause, enter the text and right click &gt; Commit
    it.</p><p>To deal with the other possibility (that the capacity &gt;= 250) we
    need to create another clause and add it to the mapping.</p><p>Again, right click on the mapping in the diagram editor or browser
    and choose New &gt; Clause. Edit and commit the clause as before.</p><pre class="programlisting">@Clause Long
  Airports::Route[ 
    name = N, 
    source = S,
    destination = D,
    capacity = C]
when C &gt;= 250
do
  LongHaul[
    name = N,
    source = S,
    destination = D]
end</pre><p>The code is similar to that of the previous clause, but the &#8220;when&#8221;
    condition requires that the capacity of the route is &gt;= 250. The
    resulting action creates an instance of a LongHaul Route.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id632105"></a>Running the Mapping</h3></div></div></div><p>Mappings can be run in two ways: via the console or by passing the
      object to the mapping.</p><p>Here's an example of running a mapping via the console. Let's
      create an instance of a Route, x, named "LAX2LHR", with a capacity of
      200 and source and destination "LAX" and "LHR" respectively..</p><p>The mapping can be run by calling the mapping and passing it the
      Route, x.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/runningthesimplemapping.jpg"></div><p>The result of the mapping is a ShortHaul Route whose name is
      "LAX2LHR" as we would expect.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/resultofsimplemapping.jpg"></div><p>The same result can be achieved by creating the same instance of a
      Route in a Snapshot and selecting Apply Mapping from the object's
      menu:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/applyingamapping.jpg"></div><p>A choice of available mappings will be displayed. Select the
      mapping that the object is to be passed to, and it will be
      invoked.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/Mappings/Images/applychoice.jpg"></div></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
