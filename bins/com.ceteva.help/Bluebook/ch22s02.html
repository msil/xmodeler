      interface for constructing and manipulating the instance. An Xtool is
      modelled and is expressed in an XTools modelling language. The language
      hides away much of the implementation detail that is necessary to
      construct tools and ensures that multiple tools over a variety of domain
      models have a consistent look and feel. In addition, since an Xtool is
      modelled, it can be mechanically processed. In particular an Xtool can
      be transformed into different formats, for example exporting the
      definition as XML or as programming language source code.</p><p>Xtools manage changes in domain model instances by raising and
      handling events. Each Xtool contains a monitor for all the events that
      can be raised on the user interface and by external agents that change
      the domain model instance. By raising and handling events, multiple
      Xtools can be seamlessly composed without having to know anything about
      each other.</p><p>All Xtools conform to a basic architecture that ensures consistent
      look and feel across all generated tools and allows Xtools to work
      together to form tool federations. This section describes the components
      of the architecture.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id629093"></a>Tool Component</h3></div></div></div><p>The basic features of an Xtool are defined in the package
      Clients::Tools::Basic:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XTools/Images/image004.jpg"></div><p>A tool consists of:</p><p>A tool type that defines how the tool&#8217;s user interface should be
      constructed and managed. A tool type is like a class in that a single
      tool type can be the type of many tools. A tool type defines named
      attributes of the tool; the value of each attribute depends on the type
      of tool we are constructing: for example, a diagram tool can have text
      attributes and image attributes whereas a form tool can have tree
      attributes and text box attributes. The tool type also defines the
      events that are generated when the user interacts with the interface.
      For example, if the tool type defines a text field called name then an
      event name_Changed will be raised whenever the user types in the text
      field.</p><p>An element manager that defines how the tool responds to events.
      Events are generated either by user interaction with the interface or by
      modifications to the underlying element managed by the tool. An element
      manager contains a collection of event handlers.</p><p>A domain element that is managed by the tool. Change events from
      the user interface cause the element manager to modify the managed
      element. Change events from the managed element cause the element
      manager to modify the user interface associated with the tool.</p><p>Note that the user interface is not a prescribed part of a tool
      definition since the details of the user interface will depend on the
      type of tool.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id626974"></a>Tool Event</h3></div></div></div><p>Tool execution occurs in the form of events. An event occurs due
      to a change arising in the user interface (such as a diagram edit); or
      due to a change in the element managed by the tool. Events are handled
      by a tool&#8217;s element manager. The element manager contains a collection
      of event handlers; each handler listens for events of a particular type.
      The event handler runs some code that handles the event when it occurs.
      Typically the code propagates a change from the user interface to the
      managed element and vice versa. The following diagram shows how events
      are handled when a change occurs to a user interface:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XTools/Images/image006.jpg"></div><p>The user performs a modification to the interface via the mouse.
      This causes a state change in the interface object which is detected by
      a monitor and translated into an event of the appropriate type. The
      event is sent from the interface to the tool and then to the element
      manager. The element manager selects an event handler by matching
      against the type of the event. When a suitable event handler has been
      selected, it is executed. The body of the event handler performs
      appropriate updates to the managed element.</p><p>Conversely, the following diagram shows how changes to the managed
      element update the user interface. An external agent changes the managed
      element. If changes to the managed element are being monitored by the
      tool (sometimes this is not required) then the changes gives rise to an
      event in the tool which, like changes to the user interface, give rise
      to an event in the element manager. An appropriate handler is selected
      which uses lookup mechanisms in the element manager to associate the
      changed element with a user interface component; the component is then
      updated.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XTools/Images/image008.jpg"></div><p>The following model shows the basic architecture of the XTools
      event mechanism:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XTools/Images/image010.jpg"></div><p>An event manager is a name space that defines event handlers. Each
      event handler has an operation that implements the code for handling the
      event. An event handler has a pattern that matches against the type of
      the event that the handler monitors. An element manager inherits
      handlers from its parents.</p><p>Creation events are typically propagated from user interface to
      managed element and vice versa. Once created, elements must be managed
      so that subsequent modification events can be propagated. An element
      manager has a table that is used to record associations between user
      interface elements and managed elements when they are created.
      Subsequent modification events can then look up the modified element in
      the table and propagate the change.</p><p>XTools provides a range of tool types. Each tool type provides a
      different collection of events. All XTool events inherit from the basic
      Event class that requires the event to record the tool that raised the
      event. The tool is particularly useful when implementing event handlers
      since it provides access to the managed element and the element manager
      with its table of associations.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id581171"></a>Tool Definition</h3></div></div></div><p>XTools provides a number of technologies for tool definition. The
      essential representation is using the XTools textual language to
      construct the tool components. The XTools classes define a number of
      grammars that must be imported using parserImport in order to use the
      textual format. The essential components of a tool definition are the
      tool type and the element manager. If the tool is to be defined in a
      single file then the following XMF code skeleton shows the key
      definitions:</p><pre class="programlisting">parserImport Tools::DiagramTools::Types;
parserImport Tools::Events;

context MyPackage

@Package NewTool

  @ToolType NewToolType

     // Type component definitions...

  end

  @ElementManager NewToolManager

    @EventHandler EventName()

      // Handler body...
    
    end

     // Event handler definitions...

  end

end</pre><p>The tool type, element manager and event handlers need not be
      defined inside their container&#8217;s textual definition. You may use context
      definitions to define these elements in isolation, for example:</p><pre class="programlisting">context MyPackage

  @ToolType NewTool

    // Type component definitions...

  end

context MyPackage

  @ElementManager NewToolManager

  end

context MyPackage::NewToolManager

  @EventHandler EventName()

    // Handler body...

  end
</pre><p>Different context definitions may exist in different files
      (probably composed using a manifest). Of course, definitions must exist
      before they can be referenced, in the build order.</p><p>Once the tool type and the element manager have been defined a new
      tool is created by instantiating the appropriate XTools tool class. For
      example, if we are defining an diagram tool then we create an instance
      of the tool class Tools::DiagramTools::Structure::Tool:</p><pre class="programlisting">import Tools::DiagramTools::Structure;
import MyPackage::NewTool;

...

let tool = Tool(toolName,NewToolType,NewToolManager,element)
in tool.showDiagram()
end

...</pre><p>A tool constructor takes four arguments: the name of the tool, the
      tool type, the tool manager and the managed element. The managed element
      can be any value: it is up to the event handlers to interpret this value
      appropriately. It is likely that new types of tool (based on diagram or
      form tools) will be required. It is easy to define your own extensions
      to these types of tool by sub-classing the appropriate Tool
      class.</p><p>Once a tool has been created, it is displayed and ready for use
      after a call of showDiagram. This call will create the user interface
      for the tool and display it. Subsequent calls to showDiagram will switch
      the tool focus back to this tool.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id618188"></a>Tool Deployment</h3></div></div></div><p>Tools can only be deployed into XMF-Mosaic in version 1.0 of
