    XML elements in a document. The parser matches against the XML as it is
    read and the parser actions are used to synthesize any XMF element.</p><p>Certain applications require access to the XML representation of the
    data. For example, the XML model may be the domain model. In this case you
    can write an XML parser that synthesizes an instance of the XML model.
    This use case is supported directly in XMF by DOMInputChannel. The use of
    this class is equivalent to writing a bespoke parser that synthesizes XML;
    however, it is much more efficient because general parsing machinery is
    not required to recognize the XML elements as they are encountered.</p><p>This section shows how DOMInputChannel works by providing a simple
    example of its use.</p><p>Consider the management of some hierarchical data such as
    classification trees, component descriptions, and organisation structures.
    The data can be maintained as a database in XML format. Database queries
    and update can be implemented as operations that work directly on the XML
    data. The following Tree package defines operations that partially
    implement such a database:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image046.jpg"></div><p>The readDB operation uses a DOM input channel to read the contents
    of a standard XML file. The result of performing the parse operation is an
    XML document whose root element is the database. The constructor for the
    class DOMInputChannel accepts an input channel that produces XML
    characters when read.</p><p>The following operation uses the print operation of XML::Document to
    write the database to a text file:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image048.jpg"></div><p>Once the database has been read (or constructed by directly creating
    instances of the XMLmodel). It can be manipulated using XOCL. The
    following operation adds a child to an element in the
    database:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image050.jpg"></div><p>The following query operation uses pattern matching to select an
    element:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image050.jpg"></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
