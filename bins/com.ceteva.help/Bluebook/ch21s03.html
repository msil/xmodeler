Each unit
    contains parser declarations followed by name space imports and then a
    sequence of commands and definitions. Both commands and definitions
    contain general XOCL expressions; an expression is the basic component of
    an XOCL language construct. All XOCL language features are evaluated to
    produce a value; in addition some features produce a side effect as a
    result of evaluation. Expressions fall into a small number of different
    categories depending on how they are evaluated. This section provides an
    overview of XOCL program features and their evaluation mechanisms.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id634424"></a>Self Evaluating Expressions</h3></div></div></div><p>The simplest type of XOCL expression is self evaluating, these are
      often referred to as constants and include integer, string, Boolean and
      float literals. In addition, the empty sequence Seq{} and the empty set
      Set{} are self evaluating.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id667614"></a>Variables and Update</h3></div></div></div><p>A name is an XOCL expression that evaluates to a value depending
      on the association that the name has in the current context. In general,
      names refer to variable locations that contain values and are often
      referred to as variables. XOCL supports three types of variable: local,
      global and slot. Examples of local variables are operation parameters
      and let-introduced names. Examples of global variables are names that
      have been imported from name spaces. Slot variables refer to the state
      of the currently executing object.</p><p>Slot variables may be qualified or unqualified. A qualified
      reference includes the object that contains the slot followed by dot (.)
      and the name of the slot. An unqualified reference is just the name of
      the slot: such a reference assumes the object containing the slot to be
      self.</p><p>Global variable references occur may be qualified or unqualified.
      A qualified reference references the global variable via some or all of
      its containing name spaces; this is similar to a path in a file system.
      For example P::Q::V refers to the variable V in the name space Q which
      itself is contained in the name space P. The name space P is assumed to
      be available at the point of reference because it is imported. An
      unqualified reference to a global variable does not include any
      containing name spaces: they must be imported at the point of
      reference.</p><p>Variables may be updated using the := operator. The left hand
      operand must be a variable and the right hand operator must be an
      expression. The expression is evaluated and the resulting value is
      placed in the variable location. Slot updates must use qualified slot
      variables. Global updates must use qualified global variables.</p><p>The following class definition contains examples of all types of
      variable reference and update:</p><pre class="programlisting">context P
  @Class C extends D, Q::E
    @Attribute v : Element end
    @Operation getV():Element
      v
    end
    @Operation setV(newV:Element)
      P::lastGoodV := self.v;
      self.v := newV
    end
    @Operation lastGoodV():Element
      import P
      in lastGoodV
      end
    end
  end</pre><p>Line 1 is an unqualified global reference to the name space P.
      Line 2 contains an unqualified global reference to D and a qualified
      global reference to E. Line 5 is an unqualified slot reference to v.
      Line 8 contains a qualified global update for lastGoodV and a qualified
      slot reference to v. Line 9 contains a qualified slot update for v and a
      local reference to newV. Line 13 contains an unqualified global
      reference to P and line 14 contains an unqualified global reference
      (since it has been imported) to lastGoodV.</p><p>Local variables are typically created when values are supplied as
      arguments to an operation or when local definitions are executed. The
      association between the Local variable name and the value persist for
      the duration of the operation definition or the execution of the body of
      the local block. In both cases, as the name suggests, variable values
      can change by side effect.</p><p>Local variables are established when arguments are passed to an
      operation or using a let expression. In both cases the variable can be
      referenced in the body of the expression, but not outside the body. In
      both cases the variables can be updated using v := e. Suppose we require
      an operation that takes two integers and returns a pair where the head
      is the smallest integer and the tail is the other integer:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Operation orderedPair(x,y)
    let min = 0;
        max = 0
    in if x &lt; y then min := x else min := y end;
       if x &gt; y then max := x else max := y end;
       Seq{min | max}
    end
  end</pre><p>The definition of orderedPair shows how a let expression can
      introduce a number of variables (in this case min and max). If the let -
      bindings are separated using ; then the bindings are established
      in-parallel meaning that the variables cannot affect each other (i.e.
      the value for max cannot refer to min and vice versa). If the bindings
      are separated using then they are established in-series meaning that
      values in subsequent bindings can refer to variables in earlier
      bindings, for example:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Operation orderedPair(x,y)
    let min = if x &lt; y then x else y end then
        max = if min = x then y else x end
    in Seq{min | max}
    end
  end</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id660536"></a>Calling Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>An operation is invoked by directly invoking it on some argument
      values or by sending an object a message for which the operation has
      been defined as the handler. The two types of invocation use the same
      underlying evaluation machinery, but are syntactically very different.
      In both cases there is only one parameter passing mechanism: values are
      passed into the operation and values with state can be modified by the
      operation. Variables cannot be modified in the sense of Pascal or Ada
      out parameters. The parameter passing mechanism is directly equivalent
      to that of Java.</p><p>Operations are applied to arguments using the conventional
      procedure call notation:</p><pre class="programlisting">p(arg1,arg2,&#8230;,argn)</pre><p>where p is an XOCL expression that evaluates to an operator and
      each argi is an XOCL expression that evaluates to produce an argument
      value.</p><p>Messages are sent to a value using the conventional method
      invocation notation:</p><pre class="programlisting">o.m(arg1,arg2,&#8230;,argn)</pre><p>where o is an XOCL expression that evaluates to produce a value
      (the receiver), m is a name and argi are the operation parameter
      expressions. To calculate the operation that is invoked, XOCL finds the
      type of o, and calculates its operator precedence list (OPL). The OPL
      contains all the operators defined by the type of o with the name m in
      order of most recently defined (with respect to inheritance) first. The
      first operation in the OPL is invoked.</p><p>The receiver of a message defines the value of self in the body of
      the operation invocation. In the case of direct operator application,
      the value of self is that which was in scope when the operator was
      defined. The value of self can be changed by sending the operation an
      invoke message:</p><pre class="programlisting">p.invoke(o,Seq{arg1,arg2,&#8230;,argn})</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id675840"></a>Infix Operators</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL supports infix notation for the usual arithmetic and boolean
      operators. In most cases the evaluation of an infix expression will
      evaluate both sub-expressions in left to right order and then perform
      the appropriate function on the results. The exceptions are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>p andthen q evaluates p, if p is false then q is not
            evaluated, otherwise this behaves as p and q.</p></li><li><p>p orelse q evaluates p, if p is true then q is not evaluated
            otherwise this behaves as p or q.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id617920"></a>Prefix Operators</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL supports one prefix operator &#8211; not. Note that prefix &#8211; for
      negative numbers is not supported (use infix &#8211; as in: 0-n).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id657763"></a>Sequencing</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL expressions may produce side effects, either by changing the
      state of values, producing output or consuming input. Expression
      evaluation is controlled using the semi-colon (;) operator that
      sequences evaluation: e1; e2 is evaluated by evaluating e1 and then
      evaluating e2. The result of the sequenced expression is the value of
      e2. This operator associates to the right.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id648703"></a>Special Forms</h3></div></div></div><p>An XOCL special form is an expression that has its own evaluation
      rules that do not necessarily follow the usual rules of sub-expression
      evaluation followed by operator call. This section lists the special
      forms and defines their evaluation rules.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Conditional expressions are defined using standard
          if&#8230;then&#8230;else&#8230;end notation. The test following the if is evaluated,
          if it is true then the consequent expression is evaluated otherwise
          the alternative expression is evaluated.</p></li><li><p>A definition occurs in a program unit as the keyword context
          followed by a name space and a n expression whose value is a named
          element. The definition causes the named element to be added to
          thename space when it is performed. The only place this type of
          definition can occur is at the top level of an evaluation
          unit.</p></li><li><p>Local variables are introduced using a let expression: let
          bindings in body end. The bindings introduce local variable names
          and their initial values. The body is an XOCL expression whose
          evaluation may reference the local variables. The variables are
          discarded when the evaluation is complete and the value of the let
          expression is the value of its body.</p></li><li><p>A set or sequence is constructed using the form
          Set{exp1,exp2,&#8230;,expn} and Seq{exp1,exp2,&#8230;,expn}. The sub-expressions
          are evaluated and the result is a set or sequence containing the
          values.</p></li><li><p>XOCL is based on OCL which provides a number of convenient
          types of iteration expression. These have the form: s-&gt;iterOp(v |
          body) where s is an expression whose value is a set or sequence,
          iterOp is one of forAll, exists, select, collect or reject, v is a
          variable name and body is an expression. Depending on the iteration
          operation the body expression is evaluated in a context where v is
          bound to successive elements selected from s. A special form of
          iteration expression is also provided: s-&gt;iterate(v w = e | body)
          where w is initialized to e and body is evaluated with v bound to
          successive elements of s; at each evaluation w is rebound to the
          value produced by body.</p></li><li><p>OCL provides a notation for invoking sequence and set
          operations: s-&gt;collOp and s-&gt;collOp(arg1,arg2,&#8230;,argn). These
          are retained in XOCL for compatibility with OCL, but are unnecessary
          since method calling notation works just as well.</p></li><li><p>A name space is imported for the scope of an expression e by
          import n in e end. All of the names defined in n are available in
          the expression e.</p></li><li><p>XOCL provides an exception mechanism for handling errors and
          other exceptional circumstances during execution. An exception is
          created and thrown from the point of error using a throw e command
          (an example of an XOCL construct that does not behave like a
          standard expression). The expression e is evaluated and can produce
          any value. XCore provides a collection of exception classes that can
          be used and extended. The exception is caught by the most recently
          established try &#8230; catch(x) &#8230; end expression. The exception can be
          handled in by the catch or may be re-thrown to the next try
          expression.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id623639"></a>Quasi-Quotes</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL is a language that provides features for meta-programming. A
      key feature of meta-programming is language processing: the ability to
      construct, transform and manipulate programs. XOCL provides quasi-quotes
      [| and |] for this purpose. Quasi-quotes can be placed around any XOCL
      expression e (including XOCL language extensions), the value of the
      resulting expression [| e |] is the syntax structure for e (as opposed
      to the value of e). For example: the value of [| x + 1 |] is not an
      integer, but a syntax structure representing an addition expression
      whose operator is + and whose left operand is a variable with name x and
      whose right operand is the constant 1.</p><p>Within quasi-quotes any expression surrounded by drop braces &lt;
      and &gt; is expected to produce syntax that is inserted into the syntax
      structure constructed by the quotes. For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">let e = [| x + 1 |]
in [| y * &lt;x&gt; |]
end</pre><p>line 1 creates a syntax structure called e that is then inserted
      into the syntax structure as the right operand of the multiplication
      expression in line 2. The resulting structure is equivalent
      to:</p><pre class="programlisting">[| y * (x + 1) |]</pre><p>Quasi quotes and drop braces are very important when
      meta-programming with languages. They make constructing code templates
      very easy. Code templates are used to construct XOCL language extensions
      and to facilitate mappings that translate from one language to
      another.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id562870"></a>The Meta Character @</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL is an extensible language. New language features are easy to
      add to XOCL to provide new expression types, new command and new
      declarative definitions. A big problem of current programming languages
      is that they cannot be extended very easily. Thus, it is not possible to
      construct abstraction mechanisms that capture the key features of the
      application domain. This results in large amounts of program code that
      is difficult to maintain. Examples of such patterns are: new types of
      looping construct; a state machine definition; the observer pattern; new
      types of interface definition; coding standards; specific types of
      classes such as containers.</p><p>XOCL provides a novel feature that allows new language constructs
      to be conveniently added to the language. Once they are added, the new
      features are seamlessly integrated with all other language constructs.
      The language feature that supports this is the meta-character @.</p><p>When an XOCL unit is processed it is syntactically analysed and
      then evaluated. During the syntax analysis phase, if an expression
      starts with the character @ then the analyzer is informed that the
      characters up to and including the corresponding end are to be processed
      by a language extension. A language extension is defined by providing a
      grammar that parses the characters from the @ to the end; the grammar is
      expected to synthesize and return a syntax construct. Grammars can be
      attached to classes and the name following the @ should be a class that
      defines a grammar. A syntax construct is required to implement the
      Performable interface that allows the second phase of XOCL unit
      processing. These two features: grammars and Performable are all that is
      necessary to allow XOCL to be arbitrarily extended with new
      constructs.</p><p>Typically, syntax classes implement the Performable interface by
      translating to existing XOCL syntax classes (that already implement the
      Performable interface). This form of language extension is termed sugar
      and the processif translation is called desugaring.</p><p>XOCL makes extensive use of the @ feature. Looping constructs such
      as While, Find and For are all implemented as extensions of the basic
      XOCL language. Definitions for classes, packages, constraints and
      operations are defined using @.</p></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
