     Operations and queries can be run in a number of different of ways in XMF-Mosaic. The following describes the most common ways. 

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id616521"></a>Running Operations on Snapshots</h3></div></div></div><p>Operations and queries can be run on objects in a snapshot.</p><p>Right click on the object in the browser and select Invoke
      Operation. This will display the operations that can be invoked on the
      object. Because all classes inherit from Object, this list will include
      all operations that have been defined for an Object. In addition,
      operations on the class will be displayed.</p><p>Only operations with zero parameters are displayed in this list
      (operations that require parameters should be accessed via the console
      or via the expression evaluator - see later).</p><p>As an example, we can call the dontMatch() query via Invoke
      Operation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/invokinganobjectoperation.jpg"></div><p>The result of running the operation will be displayed in the
      property editor.</p><p>Note that operations are immediately available via the menu once
      they have been successfully committed.</p><p>In the case of operations with parameters, we must be able to pass
      the parameters into the operation in order to call it. This can be
      achieved using the console (see later). However, there is menu based
      support for this as follows:</p><p>First assign any objects that will be used as parameter values to
      global variables. To do this right click on the object in a property
      editor and then select Assign To Global Variable. Give the object a
      name, in this case we are assigning p to a Port.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/assigninglobal.jpg"></div><p>Next, select the object that the operation is to be run on, and
      select right click &gt; Evaluate Expression.</p><p>A simple expression editor will appear. Type the operation in,
      followed by an edit() operation to show the results. Press OK to run the
      operation.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/evaluateexp.jpg"></div></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
