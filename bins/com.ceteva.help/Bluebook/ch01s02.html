      which all aspects of the tool is fully modelled. By modelled we mean a
      'high-level description'. The following diagram gives an example of the
      general-architecture of a tool built using XMF-Mosaic:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part1/Images/toolarch.jpg"></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id571167"></a>Domain Models</h3></div></div></div><p>At the heart of most application specific tools is a domain
        model. This is a model of the concepts that are manipulated by the
        tool. For example, a tool for capturing user-interfaces might contain
        concepts such as 'Button', 'Window' and so on. A domain model can also
        be viewed as representing the vocabulary of concepts that form the
        'language' of user-interface modelling.</p><p>Constructing a precise domain model is crucial to building good
        tools. XMF-Mosaic provides a a rich array of tools for this purpose.
        These allow the concepts and their relationships to be captured using
        both diagrammatical and textual syntax. In addition, domain models
        often need to be constrained by what they can represent. For example,
        we might require that a window cannot contain itself. To support this,
        XMF-Mosaic provides a rich constraint language based on OCL (the
        Object Constraint Language) and fully interactive facilities for
        creating instances of domain models and testing them against their
        constraints. The constraint language also enables complex queries over
        models to be conveniently expressed.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id571181"></a>Concrete Syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>While the domain captures the concepts manipulated by the tool,
        concrete syntax describes the concrete representation of those
        concepts. There are two main types of concrete syntax: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Diagrammatical syntax: instances of the domain concepts
              are represented as diagram elements, e.g. boxes and lines. A
              diagram editor is used to construct the diagram.</p></li><li><p>Textual syntax: instances of the domain concepts are
              represented as text, which can be parsed and edited in a text
              editor. This could programming style syntax or a standard
              representation such as XML.</p></li></ul></div><p>XMF-Mosaic provides support for both these styles of syntax.
        </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>It provides a collection of diagram and user-interface
              languages and tools called XTools. These enable domain specific
              diagram editors to be rapidly constructed along with customised
              forms and browsers.</p></li><li><p>A generic parser language is provided for building parsers
              for a wide variety of syntaxes include programming and XML
              syntaxes.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id493435"></a>Behaviour</h3></div></div></div><p>Most useful tools have executable behaviour (semantics). For
        instance, a tool for modelling user interfaces may providing rapid
        prototyping capabilities that enable prototype interfaces to be built
        and interacted with. A state machine tool might allow state machines
        to be executed, and so on.</p><p>XMF-Mosaic provides a first class programming language for
        building executable tools, called XOCL - the eXtensible Object Command
        Language. XOCL: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Supports all the key object-oriented programming
              facilities.</p></li><li><p>Provides many useful tool programming facilities,
              including patternmatching and model synchronisation
              primitives.</p></li><li><p>Is fully extensible: new programming constructs can be
              conveniently embedded in the language.</p></li><li><p>Provides full access to all meta-levels in a tool.</p></li></ul></div><p>XMF-Mosaic enables the semantics of existing languages and tools
        to be readily reused via specialisation of meta-classes, for example,
        the semantics of XMF-Mosaic's own tools can be reused and specialised
        to a specific domain.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id493496"></a>Transformations and Mappings</h3></div></div></div><p>Tools often need to transform and map the data they manage to
        different representations. This may involve transforming a model into
        another model, or mapping a model to code written in another
        language.</p><p>XMF-Mosaic provides a variety of mechanisms that support the
        convenient representations of model to model transformations and model
        to code mappings. These include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>XMap: a language for model to model transformations that
            supports pattern based mapping of input models with output
            models.</p></li><li><p>A powerful text formatting language is provided for flexible
            pretty-printing of textual code within XOCL programs.</p></li></ul></div><p>XMF-Mosaic includes a number of transformations out of the box,
        including the generation of Java from XCore models, and XML
        serialisation of models. These transformations can be readily modified
        by the user.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id493546"></a>Extensibility</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the critical features of a good tool platform is the
        ability to reuse and extend its existing capabilities.</p><p>XMF-Mosaic provides a number of approaches to achieving
        this</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>By extending existing meta-classes: Because all aspects of
            XMF-Mosaic are defined as instances of a meta-data model (XCore),
            they can be extended through class specialisation. Furthermore,
            XMF-Mosaic understands when this extension has taken place and
            automatically provides new tool buttons etc to support the
            extension.</p></li><li><p>By extending existing concrete syntax definition</p></li></ul></div><p>XMF also provides support for extensibility at the programming
        level. XOCL provides facilities for extending its syntax. This enables
        complex patterns of code to be conveniently wrapped up into simple
        programming statements. Furthermore, new programming languages can be
        rapidly added by extending existing languages.</p></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
