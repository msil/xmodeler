    component modelling domain. We will do this using a class model. This
    model will focus primarily on describing the concepts in the
    domain.</p><p>The model can be constructed as follows:</p><p>First, right click on the Components package in the browser and
    select Create Diagram &gt; Class Diagram.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/creatingaclassdiagram.png"></div><p>A class diagram editor will be shown.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id616743"></a>Adding Classes</h3></div></div></div><p>In order to add a class to the model select the Class button and
      click on the diagram. The newly added class is automatically given a
      default name.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/unamedclass.jpg"></div><p>Click on the class name to change or amend it. In this case, we
      will change the name of Class0 to ComponentModel.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/namedclass.jpg"></div><p>The properties of the class can be edited by right clicking on the
      class and selecting Edit.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/classpropertyedit.jpg"></div><p>The property editor tells us that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>The element being edited (self) is ComponentModel.</p></li><li><p>It is an instance of the class Class.</p></li><li><p>It has no attributes (see right hand panel).</p></li><li><p>Its name is ComponentModel.</p></li><li><p>It is owned by the Components package.</p></li></ul></div><p>We can ignore the grammar and default properties for now.</p><p>Let's add another class. This time a class called
      NamedElement.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/namedelement.jpg"></div><p>We want to make this abstract (i.e. non-instantiable). To do this,
      right click on the class and select Edit. In the class's property editor
      tick the isAbstract box. The name of the class will become italicised to
      indicate that it is now an abstract class.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/changetoabstract.jpg"></div><p>Let's add some more domain concepts to the model.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/addingmoreclasses.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id650878"></a>Adding Attributes</h3></div></div></div><p>Attributes are variables owned by a class. Attributes are used to
      represent properties of a class. They have a name and a type.</p><p>The class NamedElement requires an attribute 'name' of type
      String. This is added by left clicking on the selected class. From the
      Add Element menu select an Attribute of type String.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/addinganattribute.jpg"></div><p>Double click on the attribute name in the class box and change it
      to 'name'.</p><p>Attributes can also have a class as their type. They are
      represented as named arrows connecting the owner of the attribute to the
      class that is its type. Note, this use of attributes are similar to
      uni-directional associations in UML.</p><p>The relationship between a Component and a Port can be described
      by an attribute "ports" whose owner is a Component, and whose type is a
      Port.</p><p>Let's add this attribute to the model. First select the Attribute
      button in the toolbar. Select the Component class and then drag the edge
      to the Port class. Edit the name of the attribute by clicking on it. In
      this case, we are going to change it to "ports".</p><p>Note, the name of the attribute can be moved by left clicking on
      it and dragging it with the mouse.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/addinganattributeedge.jpg"></div><p>The attribute edge can be moved by clicking on it, and moving the
      cursor over the waypoint. A drag icon will appear. Click and drag the
      edge to the required position. This can also be used to add waypoints to
      the line.</p><p>A default multiplicity of <span class="bold"><strong>one</strong></span> is
      associated with the newly added attribute. Change the multiplicity by
      right clicking on the attribute line and selecting the appropriate
      multiplicity. In this case a Component is associated with <span class="bold"><strong>many </strong></span>Ports, so select * (many):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/addingmultiplicity.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id660508"></a>Adding Associations</h3></div></div></div><p>Associations represent bi-directional relationships between two
      classes. In XMF-Mosaic, an association is equivalent to a pair of
      attributes owned by two classes and a constraint which guarantees that
      there is a round-trip relationship between the attributes.</p><p>As an example, an association is required between the classes
      ComponentModel and Component.</p><p>The relationship we want to capture is that a ComponentModel
      contains many Components, and a Component is owned by a
      ComponentModel.</p><p>To create an Association, select the Association tool button and
      drag the edge from the ComponentModel to the Component. Change the names
      of the association ends as shown below. The multiplicity of each
      association end is changed by <span class="bold"><strong>right clicking on
      its role name </strong></span>and selecting Multiplicity.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/addinganassociation.jpg"></div></div><p>A more comprehensive Components model can now be constructed. Here
    further attributes have been added, along with two generalizations. The
    latter ensure that the Component and Port classes inherit the name
    attribute from the class NamedElement.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part2/CreatingAModel/Images/model.jpg"></div><p>Note: right click on an edge and select Straighten to straighten an
    edge.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
