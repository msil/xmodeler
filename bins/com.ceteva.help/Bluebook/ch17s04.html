      synthesize performable elements. The package OCL defines a complete
      language of performable classes. A convenient way of defining a new
      language feature is to define a grammar that synthesizes instances of
      OCL classes. This section describes the classes in the OCL package and
      how to use them to define new language features.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id566863"></a>The OCL Package</h3></div></div></div><p>The OCL package defines a language whose elements are extensions
      of XCore::Performable. The language has a concrete syntax that is
      defined by the grammar OCL::OCL.grammar. This grammar synthesizes
      instances of the OCL classes. All of XMF-Mosaic is written in this
      language.</p><p>Each class in the OCL package has one or more constructors. These
      constructors can be used to synthesize performable elements when
      defining new language constructs. This section defines the OCL class
      constructors.</p><p>The table below lists all of the main OCL class constructors. The
      constructors are defined in the first column and the second column
      describes what the class implements and the types of the arguments. When
      specifying the types of the arguments we refer to performable elements
      as &#8216;exps&#8217;.</p><div class="table"><a name="id629448"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 1. </b></p><table summary="" border="1"><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>Addp(left,right)</td><td>Creates an add pattern. An example is the argument

              end.</td></tr><tr><td>Apply(operator,args)</td><td>The operator expression is applied to the sequence of
              argument expressions, for example f(1,2,3).</td></tr><tr><td>BinExp(left,binOp,right)</td><td>A binary expression. The binary operator is a string. An
