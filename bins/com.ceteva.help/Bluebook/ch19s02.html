    expressing mappings. The model below contains a simple example of the XMap
    diagram language:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image004.jpg"></div><p>The example contains a mapping called Person2Cust, which takes a
    Person object and generates a Customer object.</p><p>Mappings contain rules, known as clauses. These state how one or
    more objects (the domain) are mapped to a target object (the range). Here
    is an example of a clause belonging to the Person2Cust mapping:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image006.jpg"></div><p>A clause has a name, followed by a pattern declaration, a when
    expression and a do action. Provided that the value supplied to the clause
    matches the pattern declaration, and the when expression is true, then the
    do action will execute. In this example, provided that a Person object is
    supplied whose age is &lt; 16, a Junior customer object will be created
    with the same name as the Person.</p><p>A mapping may contain more than one clause. In this example, a
    clause named Adult is also defined. It maps a Person who is older than 16
    to a Standard customer object.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XMap/Images/image008.jpg"></div><p>The rest of this document will dig deeper into the XMap language,
    starting with its syntax.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
