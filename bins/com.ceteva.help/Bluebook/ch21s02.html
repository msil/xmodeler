    Machine (XVM) and uses a library of class definitions (written in XOCL)
    called XCore. Most data types in XMF are represented as instances of XCore
    classes; however, there is a sub-set of XCore, that is fundamental to XOCL
    and its execution on XVM. These classes are the basic data types necessary
    to run XOCL. They are listed here. Their interface definitions are given
    in subsequent sections of this document.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Booleans. A boolean value is either true or false. Booleans are
        used to control branches in execution.</p></li><li><p>Clients. XMF-Mosaic can act as a client that connects to and
        communicates with an external server. The connection is constructed
        and maintained through a client value.</p></li><li><p>Channels. XOCL performs input and output through channels.
        StandardInputChannel and StandardOutputChannel define interfaces that
        are implemented by a wide variety of concrete classes that support
        different forms of input and output; for example: file i/o.</p></li><li><p>Daemons. A daemon is a value that can be attached to an object
        in XOCL that monitors the state of the object. A daemon is activated
        when the object changes state.</p></li><li><p>Integers. Positive and negative integers in the range -24^2 to
        +24^2.</p></li><li><p>Floats. 64 bit floating point numbers.</p></li><li><p>Null. The undefined value.</p></li><li><p>Objects. An object is a data value with slots. Each slot has a
        name and a value. All data in XMF is represented in on the formats in
        this list. Most data in XMF is represented as objects. All types
        (classes) in XMF are objects and all types have their own
        types.</p></li><li><p>Operations. An operation has a name, arguments and a body. The
        body of the operation is XOCL program code. When the operation is
        invoked, it is supplied with values for the arguments and it performs
        its body. An operation invocation returns the value produced by the
        body. Operations are the basis for all execution in XOCL. Operations
        are proper values in the seinse that they can be passed as argument
        values and stored in slots.</p></li><li><p>Sequences. XOCL provides lisp-like lists which it calls
        sequences. A sequence is either a cons pair with a head and a tail or
        is the empty sequence. Cons pairs have state such that the head and
        the tail may be updated. Sequences provide a very flexible and
        efficient way of organising collections of data that change over
        time.</p></li><li><p>Sets. XOCL provides a data type for representing sets. A set is
        like a sequence except that it has no state, its elements are
        unordered and it cannot contain duplicates. Although sets can be
        defined in terms of objects and sequences, they are provided as a
        basic data type for efficiency reasons (on the rare occasions that
        very large sets are necessary).</p></li><li><p>Strings. A string is a sequence of character codes. Two strings
        are equal when they have the same sequence of character codes. A
        string has no state.</p></li><li><p>Symbols. A symbol is a string with state. Two symbols are equal
        when they are the same data value in computer memory. Symbols are very
        similar to strings except they facilitate efficient name lookup in
        dictionaries. Named elements in XCore use symbols.</p></li><li><p>Tables. A table associates keys with values. Keys have hash
        codes that make lookup and update efficient in tables.</p></li><li><p>Threads. XOCL is multi-threaded. Each thread is a separate unit
        of computation that can share global data with other threads. XOCL
        multi-threading is provided to allow XMF to monitor interactions with
        multiple clients (although could be used for a variety of tasks). It
        is not expected that there would be more than 10 &#8211; 20 threads active
        at any given time.</p></li><li><p>Vectors. Vectors are fixed size, indexable sequences of
        values.</p></li></ul></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
