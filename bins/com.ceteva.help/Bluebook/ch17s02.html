      and decide how instances of the model will look when rendered in text.
      We must then define how to produce the textual representation from an
      instance and how to synthesize an instance from a textual
      representation.</p><p>This section shows how all aspects of this process are achieved in
      XMF-Mosaic. We will assume that we are defining a language from a domain
      model rather than reverse engineering a domain model from a textual language.
      All aspects apply to both of these activities.</p><p>Our domain model is that for two-dimensional tables of integers. A
      table consists of a collection of rows; each row is a sequence of column
      values. The model is shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image004.jpg"></div><p>Once we have decided on a domain model we can define a textual
      representation for instances of the model. There may be more than one
      representation (when dealing with legacy languages this is likely to be the
      case). If instances can be synthesized from more than one textual
      representation then this can easily be accommodated by defining more
      than one grammar. In this example we will keep it simple by defining a
      single representation as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image006.jpg"></div><p>The task is now to define how to translate from instances of the
      model to the text and back again. The rest of this section steps through
      the complete definition of the model, its mapping to text and its
      synthesis from text. The example is given as a complete XOCL program
      that can be compiled and loaded.</p><p>The header of the file must import all the name spaces necessary
      to define the mappings:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image008.jpg"></div><p>Lines 1 and 2 import grammars that define parsing rules used in
      the rest of the file. Line 1 imports the XOCL grammar that allows us to
      write XOCL code. Virtually all program files start with this line. Line
      2 imports the grammar that defines the textual languages for writing
      grammars (the parsing and synthesis rules for writing grammars are
      written in themselves).</p><p>Lines 4 and 5 import name spaces that define names referenced in
      the rest of the file. Line 4 imports the XMF parsing machinery that
      allows us to create a parse machine state and set it running. Line 5
      imports the IO package that allows us to open files, read and write
      channels.</p><p>We have already seen the domain model. It was originally defined
      in a text file and then displayed as a diagram. The structure of tables
      is defined below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image010.jpg"></div><p>We would like to be able to store tables in files. The following
      operation opens an output file channel and supplies it to the write
      operation for the table. By separating out the file name and the output
      operation we allow tales to be sent to other types of output channel
      (such as stdout):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image012.jpg"></div><p>The output operation write is defined below. It formats the table
      to the output channel and sends each row a write message.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image014.jpg"></div><p>We want to be able to read formatted tables from text files. We do
      this to create a table and are unlikely to read a table by sending an
      existing table a message. XMF allows operations to be defined in classes
      and called via the class (much like static methods in Java). Of course
      the value of self is not defined in operations that are used this
      way.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image016.jpg"></div><p>Note that in line 36 we reference the operation read via the
      containing class Table2D.</p><p>The read operation must parse the text from the supplied input
      channel and synthesize a table (assuming that the input is syntactically
      correct). To parse an input source we must create an instance of a
      parsing machine initialised with a grammar and the input source. The
      package Parser::Machine defines the class State that is an initial
      parsing machine state:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image018.jpg"></div><p>A parsing machine state provides an operation run that is supplied
      with a starting non-terminal name. The machine will use the rule with
      the supplied name to start the parse. If the parse is successful then
      the synthesized value is returned, otherwise an exception is raised
      describing the parse error.</p><p>We can take advantage of the operation that writes a table to an
      output channel to produce a convenient string representation for a
      table. The XMF command interpreter always uses the toString operation to
      display values at the console. The following operation uses a string
      output channel to capture the string representation of a table:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image020.jpg"></div><p>The class Row is defined simply as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image022.jpg"></div><p>The language is complete except for the definition of a grammar. A
      grammar definition can occur within a class definition or can be added
      to a class using a context definition. It is somewhat a matter of taste;
      in general it is better to organise XMF source code as a collection of
      small files that are composed using a manifest file. We have separated
      out the grammar definition in this example to keep things simple:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image024.jpg"></div><p>A grammar consists of rules or clauses that define how to parse
      and synthesize individual syntax groups. In the example above we have
      the group of rows (lines 88 &#8211; 90) and the group of tables (lines 84 &#8211;
      86).</p><p>A table is defined to be the keyword table followed by a sequence
      of rows, followed by the keyword end. If this is successfully recognized
      then the action (contained within { and }) synthesizes an instance of
      the class Table2D (a restriction on grammars is that absolute paths
      should be used to reference named elements). The variable rows is bound
      to the sequence of rows recognized in line 84. Variables bound in this
      way can be referenced in actions; rows is used to initialize the new
      instance of the table in line 85.</p><p>A row is defined to be the keyword row followed by a sequence of
      integers, followed by the keyword end. The name Int is built in to XMF
      grammars and defines the syntax of integers.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id640751"></a>Debugging</h3></div></div></div><p>When parsing input it is possible that there is a bug in the
      grammar. This can lead to incorrectly parsed input or an erroneously
      reported parse error. XMF provides a trace mechanism that allows you to
      see the steps of the parsing machine as it proceeds. Each grammar has a
      boolean slot called debug that can be used to toggle the trace
      information. The following example shows par of the trace output for the
      table language:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image026.jpg"></div><p>As the parse proceeds the trace shows the names of the clauses
      that are tried. At each step the parse state has a stack that maintains
      the values synthesized by parse actions. The top value on this stack is
      displayed in the trace (TOS =). The trace displays when terminals are
      successfully matched. The trace also displays when expectations are not
      matched by the input (not necessarily indicating an error). For example,
      the grammar entry Int* is terminated when an integer is expected but the
      terminating keyword end is encountered.</p><p>The following tool snapshot shows a very simple language
      definition for performing arithmetic calculations. The example shows
      that grammars can be defined as a stand-alone global variable
      (Calculator), although they are more often used in conjunction with
      classes. The console shows the result after compiling and loading the
      file and invoking the calculator operation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image028.jpg"></div><p>The following tool snapshot shows a grammar for a tree language
      (based on XML). The language synthesizes a nested collection of
      sequences. It is interesting because it shows the use of predicates in
      the grammar (line 15) where values bound in from actions in a clause are
      used to perform checks during the parse. The start and end tag of a
      composite element must be the same for the parse to succeed.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image030.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id629340"></a>XBNF Grammar</h3></div></div></div><p>XMF grammars are written in a textual language called XBNF. This
      language is very like extended BNF with actions written in XOCL. XBNF
      itself can be considered a language that supports language definition; it has
      a domain model and a grammar.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id653242"></a>The Grammar Domain Model</h3></div></div></div><p>An instance of the following model is synthesized when you define
      an XBNF grammar:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image032.jpg"></div><p>The rest of this section provides an overview of the components of
      the XBNF model.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Grammar: A grammar defines a number of clauses that are used
          to parse input and synthesize elements. A grammar may have a
          collection of parent grammars from which it inherits clauses. If a
          grammar inherits multiple clauses with the same name then they are
          merged using disjunction.</p></li><li><p>Clause: A clause is a parse rule. The name of the clause is a
          non-terminal of the grammar and can be called from other clauses in
          the grammar. The body of a clause is a recognizer which defines how
          to parse input and synthesize elements.</p></li><li><p>Recognizer</p></li><li><p>Action: An action consumes no input and cannot cause the parse
          to succeed or fail. When an action is encountered in the parse it is
          evaluated to synthesize a value. The value produced by the action is
          pushed onto the parse stack.</p></li><li><p>And: A conjunction of recognizers is used to sequence the left
          then the right components when encountered during a parse. This
          succeeds when the left then the right components succeed and
          synthesizes the value produced by the right component.</p></li><li><p>At: A meta-character used to define how to escape from the
          current grammar and switch to another grammar.</p></li><li><p>Bind: A bind has a name and a component recognizer. It
          succeeds when the component succeeds and binds the name to the
          synthesized value.</p></li><li><p>Call: A call references a clause by name. Control switches to
          the named clause and succeeds when the named clause succeeds. The
          value synthesized by the parse is that produced by the called
          clause.</p></li><li><p>EOF: Succeeds when the end of input is encountered.</p></li><li><p>Int : Succeeds when the next input token is an integer;
          synthesizes the integer.</p></li><li><p>Name : Succeeds when the next input token is a name;
          synthesizes a string.</p></li><li><p>Not : Succeeds when the component recognizer fails. Note that
          this does not synthesize anything and bindings occurring within the
          component recognizer are not available after the negation
          succeeds.</p></li><li><p>Opt : An optional recognizer succeeds and will consume input
          if the component recognizer matches the input. No value is
          synthesized.</p></li><li><p>Or : A disjunction succeeds when either of the component
          recognizers succeed. Bindings established within the components are
          not available outside the disjunction. No value is synthesized. When
          a disjunction is encountered, the left recognizer is tried and the
          right recognizer is recorded as a choice point. If the parse
          subsequently fails then the parser backtracks to the most recently
          established choice point and tries the alternative.</p></li><li><p>ParseError : Exception raised when an error occurs during
          parsing. An error occurs when the input cannot match the current
          recognizer and there are no alternative recognizers (arising from
          disjunctions) left to try.</p></li><li><p>Plus : Succeeds when the component recognizer has been applied
          at least once to the input. Synthesizes a sequence of values
          produced by each application of the component.</p></li><li><p>Predicate : Succeeds when the evaluation of the predicate
          returns true otherwise causes the parse to fail.</p></li><li><p>Star : Succeeds when the component recognizer has been applied
          0 or more times to the input. Synthesizes a sequence of values
          produced by each application of the component.</p></li><li><p>Str : Succeeds when the next input token is a string;
          synthesizes the string.</p></li><li><p>Terminal : Succeeds when the next input token is a named
          terminal string. No value is synthsized.</p></li><li><p>Token : The parser uses a tokenizer to process the raw stream
          of input characters into a stream of input tokens.</p></li><li><p>TypeCheck : The value synthesized by the component recognizer
          is checked against a type referenced as a path. If the value is of
          the specified type then the parse proceeds otherwise it
          fails.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id584430"></a>The XBNF Grammar</h3></div></div></div><p></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image034.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image036.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image038.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/Syntax/Images/image040.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id589455"></a>Tokens</h3></div></div></div><p></p></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
