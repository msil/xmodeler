  specific modelling domain. This typically involves specialising modelling
  concepts already provided by the tool using stereotypes and tagged values.
  The advantage of doing this is that the tool&#8217;s existing editing and drawing
  capabilities, etc, do not need to be physically changed. By combining a
  number of different stereotypes together, a &#8220;profile&#8221; can be constructed for
  a specific modelling requirement.</p><p>The disadvantage of traditional stereotype and tagged value mechanisms
  is that they are essentially just a way of annotating existing model
  elements &#8211; little in the way of semantic or well-formedness information can
  be added to them.</p><p>XMF supports stereotypes and tagged values, but in a way that is
  significantly more controllable and powerful than traditional tools. XMF
  enables &#8220;meta profiles&#8221; to be constructed, in which stereotyped elements are
  true instances of specialised language concepts.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
