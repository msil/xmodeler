Each
    value in XMF has a type or classifier that describes its structure and
    behaviour. Values in XMF are divided into objects and non-objects. Object
    types are called classes and non-object types are called classifiers. If a
    value v is of a type c then we say that v is an instance of c. XMF is
    provided with a large number of classes and classifiers; XMF developers
    can define their own classes and classifiers as extensions of those
    provided.</p><p>Classes and classifiers classify their instances by running
    constraints. A constraint is a boolean valued expression that runs in the
    context of the current state of the candidate instance. The outcome of
    constraint checking is a constraint report containing details of the
    constraints that were performed, the candidates, the outcome and a reason
    for any constraints that failed. Constraint checking is a powerful
    mechanism for checking whether a model or a model scenario is correctly
    formed.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id595688"></a>Class Definition</h3></div></div></div><p>A class describes the structure and behaviour of its instances. A
      class has a name and lives in a name-space. The following is a basic
      class that lives in the name-space Root:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root

  @Class EmptyClass

  end</pre><p>By default, the class EmptyClass specializes the XMF class
      XCore::Object and provides a single constructor for creating instances:
      EmptyClass(). If we perform the following expression:</p><pre class="programlisting">EmptyClass().isKindOf(EmptyClass)</pre><p>then the result is true since the newly created instance is
      directly an instance of EmptyClasss. In addition, the expression:</p><pre class="programlisting">EmptyClass().isKindOf(Object) and EmptyClass().isKindOf(Element)</pre><p>returns true since EmptyClass inherits (by default) from Object
      and Object inherits from Element (the class Element does not inherit
      from anywhere). The class EmptyClass is itself a value:</p><pre class="programlisting">EmptyClass.isKindOf(Class) and 
EmptyClass.isKindOf(Classifier) and 
EmptyClass.isKindOf(NamedElement) and
EmptyClass.isKindOf(Object) and 
EmptyClass.isKindOf(Element)</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id573787"></a> Attributes</h3></div></div></div><p>A class typically defines some attributes that correspond to slots
      in the instances of the class. Each attribute has a name and a type and
      may optionally have some modifiers and an initial value. The following
      is a simple example of a class with attributes:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class Point 
    @Attribute x : Integer end
    @Attribute y : Integer end
    @Constructor(x,y) ! end
  end
</pre><p>A new point is creates using the constructor defined by
      Point. A class may define any number of constructors; each constructor
      must have a different number of arguments. Each constructor argument
      corresponds to one of the attributes in the class. The optional modifier
      ! declares that the printed representation for a point is defined by
      that constructor.</p><p>A new Point is constructed:</p><pre class="programlisting">Point(100,200)</pre><p>where
      100 is the value of the slot x and 200 is the value of the slot y.
      Accessor and updater operations are automatically produced by including
      attribute modifiers:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class Point 
    @Attribute x : Integer (?,!) end
    @Attribute y : Integer (?,!) end
    @Constructor(x,y) ! end
  end</pre><p>The modifier ? defines that operations getX and getY are
      automatically provided; modifier ! defines that operations setX and setY
      are automatically provided:</p><pre class="programlisting">let p = Point(100,200)
in p.setX(p.getX() - 1);
   p.setY(p.getY() - 1)
end</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id617717"></a>Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>Object-oriented execution proceeds by message passing; a message
      consists of a name and some argument values. When a message is sent to
      an object, the name is looked up in the class of the object (and its
      parents); if an operation is found then it is invoked otherwise an error
      is reported. Operations may be defined as part of a class or a package
      definition or added to existing classes and packages via a context
      defintion.</p><p>The following defines a class of stacks and adds the definition to
      a package named Stacks. The example shows the complete contents of a
      file containing the definition. XMF can be used in a file-based mode
      where files contain source code that is compiled using the XMF compiler.
      The compiled binary is then loaded into XMF.</p><pre class="programlisting">parserImport XOCL;

context Stacks

  @Class Stack
  
    @Attribute elements : Seq(Element) end
    @Attribute index : Integer end 
    
    @Operation isEmpty():Boolean
      self.elements-&gt;isEmpty
    end
    
    @Operation pop()
      if self.isEmpty()
      then throw StackUnderflow(self)
      else 
        let head = elements-&gt;head
        in self.elements := elements-&gt;tail;
           head
        end
      end
    end

    @Operation push(e:Element)
      self.elements := Seq{e | elements}
    end

    @Operation top()
      if self.isEmpty()
      then throw StackUnderflow(self)
      else elements-&gt;head
      end
    end

      other class. By default a class is a sub-class of XCore::Object. A class
      inherits constructors, attributes, operations and constraints from its
      parent. For example the following class specializes Point with a z
      co-ordinate:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class Point3D extends Point
    @Attribute z : Integer (?,!) end
    @Constructor(x,y,z) ! end
  end
</pre><p>An instance of Point3D may be constructed using a two-place
      constructor or a three-place constructor (the three-place is probably
      more useful). An instance of the class Point3D is also an instance of
      the parent class Point:</p><pre class="programlisting">let p = Point3D(1,2,3)
in p.isKindOf(Point)
end</pre><p>returns true.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id625864"></a>Multiple</h4></div></div></div><p>A class may inherit from more than one super-class in which case
        the sequence of parents is given by comma separated paths after the
        extends keyword. The order of the parents is used to determine the
        lookup order for operations, although it is considered bad practice to
        rely on the ordering when handling messages. </p><p>Multiple inheritance is most useful when inheriting orthogonal
        behaviour and structure that is then extended in the new
        sub-class.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id671239"></a>Run-Super</h4></div></div></div><p>When a sub-class extends a super-class it may shadow an existing
        operation by defining a new operation in the sub-class with the same
        name and arity as an inherited class. Sending a message to an instance
        of the sub-class will cause the shadowing operation definition to be
        performed.</p><p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to reference a shadowed
        operation from a shadowing operation body. This occurs when the
        shadowing class extends the behaviour of the shadowed class. XMF
        provides the keyword super that is used to invoke the shadowed
        operation from the shadowing operation.</p><p>This section provides a simple example of how super is
        used.</p></div></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
