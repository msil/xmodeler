    channel. The former provides a convenient way of declaring XML patterns
    and synthesizing XMF data. The latter provides a convenient way of
    translating an XML input source into an instance of the XML model.
    Occasionally, the XML instance is not required and the overhead of using
    general parsing machinery seems unnecessary. For example, if we wanted to
    count the number of elements in the input or check whether an element with
    a given tag exists in the input.</p><p>For occasions where parsing is unnecessary and DOM is not required,
    XMF provides a SAX input channel. A SAX input channel processes the XML
    input by generating events each time an XML node is encountered in the
    input. The channel has handlers that are called when the events are fired.
    XMF works hard to ensure that the input is processed as efficiently as
    possible and therefore, SAX input channels are appropriate for processing
    very large XML data sources.</p><p>The key operations called on an instance of SAXInputChannel are as
    follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">startElement(tag:Buffer,attributes:Buffer)</pre><p>This operation is called when each element is encountered in the
    input. The tag of the element is supplied as a string buffer and the
    attributes are supplied as a buffer containing instances of
    XML::IO::SAXAttribute with attributes name and value both of type string
    buffer. All buffers are reused in order to ensure the input is processed
    as efficiently as possible. Therefore if you wish to retain the tag, or
    the attribute names or attribute values then the buffers should be
    transformed into the equivalent strings using toString.</p><pre class="programlisting">endElement(tag:Buffer)</pre><p>This operation is called when the end tag of each element is
    encountered in the input. The tag is a string buffer that is subsequently
    reused as above.</p><pre class="programlisting">characters(text:Buffer)</pre><p>This
    operation is called when text is encountered in the input. The text is
    supplied as a string buffer that is subsequently reused as above.</p><pre class="programlisting">parse()</pre><p>Call this operation to start
    processing the input. No value is returned by default. Extend this
    operation in sub-classes of SAXInputChannel to construct and return values
    based on the operations defined above.</p><pre class="programlisting">SAXInputChannel(inch:InputChanel)</pre><p>A
    constructor for SAX input channels. The argument is an input channel that
    produces XML text.</p><p>This section shows how SAX input channels work in XMF by
    implementing a DOM input channel in terms of a SAX input channel. The
    following tool screenshot shows the class uses a stack to manage the XML
    nodes as they are read and synthesized by the operations defined
    above:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image054.jpg"></div><p>When the input source is parsed, the intermediate XML nodes are
    pushed and popped on the stack. Child nodes are popped when the end
    element event occurs and added to the currently open element on the stack.
    Eventually, the root node is left as the single stack element. The parse
    just pops the root node, creates and returns an XML document:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image056.jpg"></div><p>When the characters operation is called, a Text node is created and
    pushed on the stack. Note how toString is used to copy the text on the
    string buffer:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image058.jpg"></div><p>When a new element node is encountered in the input we create a new
    XML element object and push it on the stack. Between the start element
    event and the associated end element event there will be any number of
    events that create the children nodes. The children nodes will be pushed
    on the stack. When the end element event occurs it is straightforward to
    pop the child elements from the stack up to the parent element and modify
    the parent by inserting the children:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image060.jpg"></div><p>The end element event causes all the children that have been pushed
    since the corresponding parent element node to be popped and
    inserted:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image062.jpg"></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image064.jpg"></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
