  data. For example, there may be a third party tool that does some pre- or
  post-processing tasks on the data, or we may want to maintain models and
  instances of models as XML files.</p><p>This section describes how an XML parser and generator can be
  constructed in XMF-Mosaic enabling any format of XML to be parsed and
  exported to a from an instance of a model. It is based on (XXML) a generic,
  high-level grammar language that can be used to capture XML grammars and the
  rules for mapping them to models.</p><p>The following sections give an example of its application to the
  Components model, enabling instances of the model to be represented as and
  parsed as XML.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
