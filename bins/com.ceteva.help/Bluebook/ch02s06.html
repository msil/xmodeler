    that its models are fully interactive. In XMF-Mosaic you can create and
    visualise instances of models in a variety of different ways, and then
    write operations, transformations, etc. that do things with the models.
    The ability to interact with models is essential when capturing and
    validating detailed properties of a complex problem domain. In addition,
    because XMF-Mosaic is itself completely modelled, all the properties of
    the tool can be accessed in exactly the same way, resulting in a
    consistent and highly interoperable approach to tool definition.</p><p>The following sections describe these facilities in detail.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
