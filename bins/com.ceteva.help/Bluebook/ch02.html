  application domain, is to precisely capture the domain concepts that the
  tool will manipulate.</p><p>To do this, we need to construct a <span class="emphasis"><em>domain model</em></span>.
  A domain model captures the key concepts in the domain, along with their
  properties and relationships. For example, if the domain is business
  processes, then we would aim to capture all the concepts of a business
  process (activities, flow, constraints, etc) in the model.</p><p>This part describes how to <span class="emphasis"><em>model</em></span> the concepts in
  a domain. It describes how to capture the domain concepts as class models,
  and how the model can be enriched with constraints, operations and
  constructors. It then shows how the powerful dynamic capabiltites of
  XMF-Mosaic can be used to validate the domain model, through the creation of
  model instances and by executing the model.</p></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
