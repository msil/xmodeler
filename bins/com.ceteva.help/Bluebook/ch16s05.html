Languages
    control the structure and behaviour of the values that they denote. In
    this sense, language design is a meta-activity and requires a
    meta-language that represents the structure and behaviour of the language
    components.</p><p>XMF provides a meta-circular object-oriented kernel language called
    XOCL. The meta-circular property means that XOCL is defined completely in
    itself. This property validates XOCL as a meta-language.
    Object-orientation provides a basis for application extension and reuse
    through inheritance and modularity through encapsulation. </p><p>XOCL is both meta-circular and object-oriented, it is suitable for
    language definition where languages can be easily constructed as modular
    extensions of the basic XOCL language. Instantiations of XOCL are
    languages and extensions of XOCL are meta-languages.</p><p>All languages have key semantic features that can be represented as
    an interface in the definition of the language. Consider a language with
    an operational semantics. In this case programs written in the language
    may be viewed as controlling a machine that contains the state of the
    execution at any given snapshot in time. The key semantic features of the
    language form the API of the machine.</p><p>Given a language L, we would like to construct a new language that
    is L-like. If L is defined using object-oriented principles then it is
    attractive to construct the new language as an extension of L using
    inheritance. Syntax structures and values of the new language can be
    defined by extending the appropriate features of L. We would like to
    construct the semantics of the new language using the same approach. If we
    have constructed the semantics of L by encapsulating the key features as
    an implementation of the API as described above, then the new language
    semantics can be defined by inheriting and extending these operations as
    appropriate.</p><p>Where the semantics of a language has been constructed using
    object-oriented principles, the resulting collection of classes and
    operations is referred to as a meta-object-protocol. This section
    describes the XOCL MOP. </p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id581846"></a>Message Passing</h3></div></div></div><p>XOCL performs computation in terms of messages between elements. A
      message consists of a name andsome data. A message is sent from a source
      element to a target element. The target element receives themessage,
      performs appropriate computation and returns a result. Messages between
      elements aresynchronous: the source element halts computation and waits
      the return value from the target element.</p><p>Message passing occurs when the source element performs an
      expression of the form: o.m(x,y,z,...) where o is the target element, m
      is the message name and x, y, z etc. is the data, or parameters, of the
      message.</p><p>Message passing is defined by the MOP component referred to as the
      massage passing protocol.The protocol is defined by the meta-class of
      the target element and is called sendInstance:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Element
  @Operation send(message,args):Element
    self.of().sendInstance(self,message,args)
  end
</pre><p>A default protocol is provided by the Kernel meta-class
      Classifier:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Classifier
  @Operation sendInstance(element,name,args)
    // Get all the operations of element with the 
    // correct name and arity. Select the most 
    // specific and invoke it.
    let arity = args-&gt;size then
        operations = element.of().allOperations()
          -&gt;asSeq
          -&gt;select(o | o.name = name and o.arity() = arity)
    in if operations-&gt;isEmpty
       then 
         element.error("Cannot handle "+message+"/"+arity)
       else operations-&gt;head.invoke(element,args)
       end
    end
  end
</pre><p>Since Class is a sub-class of Classifier, any sub-class of
      Class that defines a new sendInstance operation will provide a
      specialized message passing protocol for the instances of its instances.
      This can be used to implement specialized operation lookup mechanisms,
      to facilitiate debugging information and to change the basic message
      passing mechanisms (for example by defining a class of objects with
      message queues). </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id622515"></a>Object Creation</h3></div></div></div><p>Objects are created by sending a new message to a class together
      with some initialization data. The preferred way of invoking the new
      operation of a class is to apply the class as an operator to the
      initialization arguments. This is preferred because it is succinct and
      because the compiler and XMF VM can handle class instantiation more
      efficiently in this form:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Classifier
  @Operation invoke(target:Element,args:Seq(Element)):Element
    self.new(args)
  end</pre><p>The new operation is defined by the meta-class of the
      receiving class. It constitutes the instantiation procotol for a
      collection of classes. The class Classifier defines the default
      instantiation protocol:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Classifier
  @Operation new(args:Seq(Element)):Element
    self.new().init(args)
  end</pre><p>where the operation new creates an empty new instance of the
      receiver and init initializes the new instance. </p><p>Sub-classes of Classifier can define their own instantiation
      protocol. Typically this will use super to create an instance using the
      default protocol and then perform some extra computation to initialize
      the new instance; however, in principle the instantiation protocol can
      by-pass the default protocol altogether. To create a raw instance of a
      class C and add a single slot named "x" with initial value 10 you can do
      the following:</p><pre class="programlisting">let o = Kernel_mkObj()
in Kernel_setOf(o,C);
   Kernel_addAtt(o,Symbol("x",100));
   o
end</pre><p>Using the kernel-level operations, you can create a
      completely bespoke instantiation protocol. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id762594"></a>Slot Access</h3></div></div></div><p>Objects have internal storage in the form of named slots. Access
      to a slot value is via the object and the name of the slot. Slots are
      named using symbols. Access is defined by the object's slot access
      protocol. The slot access protocol is used when an expression of the
      form o.a is performed. Access involves checking that the slot exists and
      then accessing the value of the slot.</p><p>The existence of a slot can be checked using the hasSlot operation
      defined by Object:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Object 
  @Operation hasSlot(name):Boolean
    self.of().hasInstanceSlot(self,name)
  end</pre><p>The hasSlot operation invokes the hasInstanceSlot operation of the
      object's class. hasInstanceSlot forms part of the slot access protocol
      for the object; the operation is defined by the object's meta-class. The
      default definition is provided by Class and uses the kernel operation
      Kernel_hasSlot to directly check whether there is a machine-level
      slot:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Class
  @Operation hasInstanceSlot(object,name)
    Kernel_hasSlot(object,name)
  end</pre><p>Access to a slot's value is provided by the operation get defined
      by Object:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Object
  @Operation get(name:String):Element
    self.of().getInstanceSlot(self,name)
  end
</pre><p>The operation getInstanceSlot is defined by an object's meta-class
      and describes how to access the storage associated with an object and a
      slot name. The default protocol is provided by Class and uses the kernel
      operation Kernel_getSlotValue to access the machine-level slot (as added
      using Kernel_addAtt):</p><pre class="programlisting">context Class
  @Operation getInstanceSlot(object,name)
    Kernel_getSlotValue(object,name)
  end</pre><p>Typically a new slot access protocol is required because a
      collection of classes implement object storage in a non-standard way
      (for example using a table, in a data base or distributed over a
      network).</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id640002"></a>Slot Update</h3></div></div></div><p>The value of an object's slot can be updated using the object's
      slot update protocol. A slot is updated when an expression of the form
      o.a := e is performed. The class Object provides an operation used to
      set the value of a slot:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Object
  @Operation set(name:String,value:Element):Element
    self.of().setInstanceSlot(self,name,value);
    self
  end
</pre><p>The object's meta-class defines an operation setInstanceSlot that
      forms the update protocol. The default update protocol is defined by
      Class and uses the kernel-level operation Kernel_setSlotValue to update
      the machine-level slot and to invoke any daemons that are defined on the
      object:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Class
  @Operation setInstanceSlot(object,name,value)
    Kernel_setSlotValue(object,name,value)
  end</pre><p>A new slot update protocol is used to circumvent the
      default storage. For example the storage for a slot may be in a database
      or accessed over a network. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id702128"></a>Default Parents</h3></div></div></div><p>A class is created as an instance of a meta-class. When a class is
      created it must have some parents. The meta-class defines an operation
      defaultParents that produces a set of classes that are the default
      parents for its instances. The basic definition for defaultParents is
      provided by Classifier:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Classifier
  @Operation defaultParents():Set(Classifier)
    Set{Element}
  end</pre><p>Most classes are instances of the class Class, that
      overrides the definition as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Class
  @Operation defaultParents():Set(Classifier)
    Set{Object}
  end</pre></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id610452"></a>Example</h3></div></div></div><p>Suppose that we want to define a class of objects that can have
      standard attribute defined slots in addition to dynamic slots. Attribute
      defined slots are defined at the class level. Dynamic slots are defined
      at the object level and can be added and removed dynamically. Both types
      of slot can be accessed and updated via the standard protocols using o.a
      and o.a := e expressions.</p><p>In order to implement these objects we require a new slot access
      and update protocol. The protocol is defined at the meta-level and is to
      be called the Elastic protocol. We require two new classes:
      ElasticObject that is the super-class of all user-defined elastic
      classes; and, ElasticClass that defines the elastic protocol.</p><p>The class ElasticObject uses a table to contain the dynamic
      slots:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class ElasticObject
    @Attribute slots : Table = Table(100) end
  end</pre><p>An elastic object provides operations to add and remove the
      dynamic slots:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticObject
  @Operation addSlot(name:String,value)
    slots.put(Symbol(name),value)
  end

context ElasticObject
  @Operation removeSlot(name)
    slots.remove(Symbol(name))
  end</pre><p>An elastic object can remove all the dynamic
      slots:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticObject
  @Operation removeAll()
    @For key inTableKeys slots do
      self.removeSlot(key.toString())
    end
  end</pre><p>An elastic object can increment the values of all the dynamic
      slots. Note that incAll uses the slot access and update protocol for the
      object to change the value of the dynamic slots:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticObject
  @Operation incAll()
    @For key inTableKeys slots do
      self.set(key,self.get(key) + 1)
    end
  end</pre><p>The class ElasticClass defines the elastic MOP:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class ElasticClass extends Class
  end</pre><p>ElasticObject must be a parent of any elastic
      class:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticClass
  @Operation defaultParents()
    Set{ElasticObject}
  end</pre><p>The elastic slot access protocol inspects the slots table to see
      if the required slot is defined there. If not then the protocol uses
      super to revert to the default protocol inherited from
      Class:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticClass
  @Operation getInstanceSlot(object,name)
    if Kernel_getSlotValue(object,Symbol("slots")).hasKey(name)
    then Kernel_getSlotValue(object,Symbol("slots")).get(name)
    else super(object,name)
    end
  end

context ElasticClass
  @Operation setInstanceSlot(object,name,value)
    if Kernel_getSlotValue(object,Symbol("slots")).hasKey(name)
    then Kernel_getSlotValue(object,Symbol("slots")).put(name,value)
    else super(object,name,value)
    end
  end

context ElasticClass
  @Operation hasInstanceSlot(object,name)
    if Kernel_getSlotValue(object,Symbol("slots")).hasKey(name)
    then true
    else super(object,name)
    end
  end</pre><p>There is no specific need for sendInstance in the elastic
      protocol, however it is defined for completeness and simply prints a
      message before reverting to the default protocol:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticClass
  @Operation sendInstance(element,message,args)
    format(stdout,"Sending message ~S(~{,~;~S~})~%",Seq{message,args});
    super(element,message,args)
  end</pre><p>There is no specific need for new in the elastic protocol, however
      it is defined for completeness and simply prints a message before
      reverting to the default protocol:</p><pre class="programlisting">context ElasticClass
  @Operation new(args)
    format(stdout,"Creating a new instance of an elastic class~%");
    super(args)
  end</pre><p>The following is an example class definition that specifies its
      meta-class as ElasticClass:</p><pre class="programlisting">context Root
  @Class C metaclass ElasticClass
    @Attribute s : Element end
    @Operation test()
      self.addSlot("x",100);
      self.addSlot("y",200);
      self.addSlot("z",300);
      self.x := self.x + 1;
      self.y := self.y + 1;
      self.z := self.z + 1;
      self.incAll();
      self.s := self.x + self.y + self.z;
      self.removeAll();
      s
    end
  end</pre></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
