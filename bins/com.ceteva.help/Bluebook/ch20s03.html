      In most cases, an application is required to translate the XML input
      into XMF data elements. This can be achieved by reading the XML source
      character by character, but fortunately XMF provides XML parsing
      technology that interprets declarative rules specifying how to match XML
      input and synthesize XMF elements.</p><p>An XMF parser reads an XML input source and interprets an XML
      grammar. And XML grammar consists of a collection of clauses. Each
      clause defines how to match a portion of the input and how to translate
      it into XMF data. An XML grammar can be viewed as the type of an XML
      document in the same way as a DTD. Unlike DTDs, grammar components are
      associated with actions that are performed when the appropriate portion
      of the input has been successfully consumed.</p><p>This section shows how to define XML grammars and how to run XML
      parsers. It starts with a number of examples that contain key technology
      features. Finally the XML grammar model is defined in full with a
      complete definition of the components.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id680516"></a>Example</h3></div></div></div><p></p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id636641"></a>Two Dimensional Tables</h4></div></div></div><p>This section gives an example of how to read the XML
        representation of a simple domain model and synthesize an instance of
        the model. The following model represents two dimensional integer
        tables:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image006.jpg"></div><p>Suppose that we have been supplied with an XML document that
        contains a two-dimensional integer table. We want to read the XML and
        produce an instance of the domain model. This situation occurs
        frequently in system development when we are supplied with data that
        has been exported from a third party tool and we want to process the
        information using XMF. Alternatively, it may occur when we have used
        XML as the format for storing data from a previous use of
        XMF-Mosaic.</p><p>The following screen shot shows how the data could be expressed
        in XML:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image008.jpg"></div><p>The XML is to be parsed using a grammar that defines how to
        match tables, rows and columns. An XML grammar consists of a
        collection of clauses each of which defines how to match elements,
        their attributes and their children.</p><p>An XML source (such as a file) is read and each element is
        matched against the clauses in the grammar. When a clause matches
        against the current XML input element, its action is performed causing
        an XMF element to be synthesized.</p><p>Matching an element involves matching its tag, attributes and
        its children. All of these components must match in order for the
        match to be successful. Attribute values can be extracted as part of
        the matching process and passed to the synthesizing actions. Values
        synthesized by matching children can be used in the actions of a
        parent. This way information can be extracted from the XML elements as
        they are consumed and synthesized elements can be passed up the tree
        as it is consumed. Eventually the result of the parse is the value
        synthesized by the root element of the XML document. The following
        tool screenshot shows the content of a source file that defines an XML
        grammar for parsing two-dimensional tables. The file imports the
        XML::Parser package in line 1 so that the grammar for parsing XML
        grammars is available in the rest of the file. Line 4 imports the same
        package so that names can be referenced in code (for example
        ParserChannel in line 40).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image010.jpg"></div><p>In order to use an XML grammar to parse and synthesize an XML
        source, the grammar must be compiled. Compilation processes the
        grammar, checks it for any errors and then translates it into an
        efficient parsing table. The table is then used as the input to a
        general XML parsing engine. Compilation checks for a number of errors.
        In particular it checks that the grammar is LL(1). An LL(1) grammar
        allows the parser to proceed based on one token lookahead. In this
        case, tokens are XML elements. Fortunately, LL(1) grammars can be
        easily checked and this is done automatically for you. If you specify
        a non-LL(1) grammar, XMF will report a warning and indicate where you
        have gone wrong.</p><p>To use a compiled grammar, you create an instance of
        XML::Parser::ParserChannel. The constructor for this class accepts an
        XML grammar and an XML input source. A parser channel has an operation
        parse that is used to consume input from the XML source, to run the
        parser and return the synthesized result:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image012.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id570342"></a>Dealing with References</h4></div></div></div><p>XML data is tree-structured. This means that data elements
        cannot be shared by multiple paths from the root element. This is not
        true of XMF data elements, and computer data structures in general.
        General data elements are graphs where individual elements may be
        shared (or pointed to) by multiple parents.</p><p>This restriction on XML data representation is usually handled
        using data identifiers and references. Any element that can be
        referenced by multiple sources is allocated a unique identifier. One
        of the occurrences of the element is translated into an XML tree and
        all other occurrences are encoded in the reference source using the
        identifier. It is then up to the interpretation of the XML data to
        faithfully interpret the identifiers and their references. XMF manages
        identifiers and references automatically providing they are
        appropriately declared in the XML grammar. This section shows how this
        is achieved using a simple example of encoding graphs using
        XML.</p><p>The following model is used to represent graphs:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image014.jpg"></div><p>A graph can be represented in XML as follows. A node can be
        accessed by the containing graph through a number of routes: via the
        nodes attribute or via the source or target attributes of edges.
        Sharing of a node through multiple routes is encoded in the XML by
        allocating a unique identifier to each node. Nodes are represented
        using an XML element with the unique tag within the graph element and
        referenced using their identifier via edges:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image016.jpg"></div><p>We will synthesize an instance of the graph model using an XML
        grammar. The grammar is defined as a named element in a package as
        shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image018.jpg"></div><p>An XML element representing a node is parsed and an instance of
        the class Graph::Node is synthesized by the clause defined below. A
        node has attributes id and data which are matched and bound to clause
        variables in line 31. The clause synthesizes a node which is
        associated with the identifier bound to the variable id:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image020.jpg"></div><p>Edges are parsed and synthesized by the clause defined below.
        Instances of the class Graph::Edge refer to the graph nodes; but,
        nodes are not available at this point in the parse since the XML
        elements refer to the source and target nodes via their ids. An XML
        parser can indicate that an identifier reference should be replaced
        with the associated value that is synthesized elsewhere by including a
        reference in the result of the clause as shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image022.jpg"></div><p>The following operation shows how the Graph grammar is used to
        parse a file containing a graph encoded in XML.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image024.jpg"></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id618362"></a>Representing Models in XML</h4></div></div></div><p>Most modelling tools allow you to encode models using XML; often
        this is the only way of saving and loading models to persistent
        storage. The various versions of XMI for UML is an example of this
        kind of model encoding. XMF-Mosaic allows models to be encoded in a
        variety of ways and in particular allows you to develop your own
        encoding that suits the domain with which you are modelling. This
        section provides an overview of how models can be encoded using an
        XMI-style XML format.</p><p>The following XML document shows a simple model
        encoding:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image026.jpg"></div><p>Models are just top-level packages containing standard elements
        such as classes and sub-packages. Each model element is allocated a
        unique identifier to facilitate cross model references. An example of
        a reference occurs in the attributes of the model where the type of
        the attribute is encoded as a reference to a class that is represented
        in full elsewhere in the document.</p><p>The result of loading the XML model is shown below:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image028.jpg"></div><p>The model is synthesized by parsing an XML grammar. The grammar
        is shown below. Each identifier is registered against the associated
        model element during the parse using :=:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image030.jpg"></div><p>You should be careful when using references (instances of
        XML::Parser::Ref) as initialization arguments in class instantiation
        because class instantiation may process the arguments and expect them
        to be data values of the referenced type rather than the reference
        itself. In the following construction of a class we use a keyword
        constructor since the parents may be references (in which case
        addParent will fail since it expects a classifier rather than a
        reference).</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image032.jpg"></div><p>The definition of Attribute below shows a typical scenario where
        XML attributes encode information that must be processed in order to
        synthesize the model element. In this case the multiplicity of the
        attribute (whether it is atomic, a set type or a sequence type) is
        encoded as an enumerated type that is processed in order to decide
        what the type of the attribute will be.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image034.jpg"></div><p>The following ClassRef definition shows how references are
        synthesized:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image036.jpg"></div><p>Finally, the following operation can be used to read a file
        containing a model that is encoded in XML:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image038.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id622134"></a>Debugging XML Grammars</h3></div></div></div><p>An XML parser channel has an attribute debug that can be used to
      provide a trace of execution. If the flag is set:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image040.jpg"></div><p>then output is produced that shows the XML input as it is
      consumed, shows the result of actions as they are performed and shows
      the clause variables as they are bound. The following is a partial trace
      produced by reading a graph with debug set:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Part3/XML/Images/image042.jpg"></div></div></div><p></p><p><img src="copyright.gif"></p></body></html>
